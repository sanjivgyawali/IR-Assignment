0,"Reports claim that the sweetener aspartame, commonly found in various foods and fizzy drinks, is set to be officially classified as ""possibly carcinogenic"" to humans. However, the label ""possibly carcinogenic"" does not indicate the magnitude of the potential risk. Other substances classified as ""possibly carcinogenic"" include aloe vera, diesel, and pickled Asian vegetables. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) is expected to make an announcement on July 14th. Aspartame, which is 200 times sweeter than sugar, provides a sweet taste without the added calories. It is commonly found in diet drinks, chewing gums, and some yogurts. The sweetener has been in use for decades and has been approved by food safety bodies, but there has been controversy surrounding its safety.

The IARC, the cancer research arm of the World Health Organization, has been conducting a review of approximately 1,300 studies on aspartame and cancer. The Reuters news agency has reported that aspartame will be classified as ""possibly carcinogenic."" However, it is important to note that this classification does not indicate the actual level of risk associated with aspartame. The IARC classifications provide information on the strength of the evidence rather than the actual risk to health. The ""possibly"" category is used when there is limited evidence from human or animal studies. It is worth noting that substances categorized in this group do not have strong evidence suggesting they cause cancer.

The IARC classifications have been criticized in the past for causing confusion and unnecessary alarm. It is important to interpret these classifications correctly. The exact risk associated with aspartame is not provided in the data. The Joint World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization's Expert Committee on Food Additives is expected to release a report in July, which may provide further information. Previous scientific committees have considered aspartame safe for consumption at current permitted use levels. Studies linking aspartame to cancer have been controversial, with conflicting results from animal and human studies. Aspartame is generally regarded as safe, except for individuals with an inherited condition called phenylketonuria (PKU), who cannot metabolize a component of aspartame.",health
1,"Scientists have discovered a key defense mechanism that effectively blocks the majority of bird flu strains from invading our bodies. Bird flus have caused four pandemics since 1918, resulting in millions of deaths. Researchers from the University of Glasgow found that these pandemics, along with regular winter flus, have evolved strategies to bypass this natural defense barrier. The team believes that soon they will be able to predict which bird flu strains pose the greatest risk.

The scientists conducted investigations into spillover events, which occur when a person becomes infected by an animal. This cross-species transmission is a critical step in the emergence of a new pandemic. Through laboratory experiments, the researchers identified a specific section of our DNA called BTN3A3 that becomes activated in response to infection. BTN3A3 was found to be active in the nose, throat, and lungs, reducing the ability of bird flu strains to replicate.

Dr. Rute Maria Pinto, one of the researchers, stated that ""nearly all"" bird flu strains are unable to bypass this protective mechanism and therefore cannot infect humans. However, most human viruses, including pandemic strains, have evolved resistance to BTN3A3 and can overcome this defense barrier.

There is an ongoing risk of bird flu strains crossing over into humans, as wild birds harbor various flu viruses, and poultry poses a significant risk due to the large number of farmed animals in close proximity to humans. The 1918 flu pandemic, which is estimated to have caused 50 million deaths, is believed to have originated in birds. The researchers discovered that a specific bird flu strain called H7N9 developed higher resistance to BTN3A3 before the first human cases emerged in 2013.

The researchers envision a future where the genetic code of circulating bird flu strains can be routinely analyzed and dangerous strains identified. This knowledge would enable targeted measures to be implemented to control high-risk viruses. Prof Massimo Palmarini, director of the Centre for Virus Research in Glasgow, explained that sequencing the virus's genetic code would allow scientists to assess the likelihood of a virus crossing over to humans.

Regarding the current bird flu outbreak, the largest ever recorded, more than 50% of virus samples from birds and all seven human cases detected this year have shown resistance to BTN3A3. However, bypassing BTN3A3 is just one aspect of the virus's threat to human health, and other factors must be considered. Dr. Stephen Oakeshott from the Medical Research Council emphasized the importance of mechanistic scientific insights and genetic surveillance in understanding viral transmission between species and informing public health planning.",health
2,"An appeal has been launched to raise one million pounds for the leukaemia treatment of a 20-month-old girl named Hallie from Coventry. Hallie was diagnosed with leukaemia at Birmingham Children's Hospital when she was eight months old. After her last stem cell transplant failed, her family was informed that their best option might be to seek treatment in the United States. Hallie's aunt, Hannah Dugdale, described it as a daunting task.

Hallie was first diagnosed with a rare form of leukaemia called JMML in the summer of 2022 while on a family vacation in Spain. She was flown back home for treatment and has since undergone chemotherapy, blood transfusions, and two stem cell transplants. On Thursday, the family learned that the latest transplant had not been successful, and a consultant at the Birmingham hospital suggested CAR T-cell therapy as their remaining option. CAR T-cell therapy involves genetically modifying immune system cells called T cells to enhance their effectiveness in targeting cancer cells, which are then reintroduced into the patient's bloodstream.

Although a trial for CAR T-cell therapy is scheduled to begin at Great Ormond Street Hospital in the coming months, Hallie's family prefers not to wait and hopes to take her to the United States for treatment. However, the third transplant required for the treatment is not funded by the National Health Service (NHS). Hallie's aunt expressed that her niece deserves every chance at a long and happy life and described her sister, Kim, as devastated but also grateful for the overwhelming support they have received. The fundraising appeal has already surpassed 180,000, and they hope to commence treatment before reaching the full amount through their Go Fund Me page.

Birmingham Children's Hospital stated that a third transplant is not a current treatment option for Hallie's rare form of leukaemia. However, the hospital's teams are actively exploring other possibilities for her, including the potential of experimental CAR T-cell therapy as part of a clinical trial. NHS England has been contacted for a response regarding the matter.",health
3,"European Union (EU) officials are strongly recommending that all member states require negative Covid tests from Chinese arrivals before they travel, as travel in and out of China is set to become easier due to the scrapping of the ""zero-Covid"" policy. China is currently experiencing a surge in Covid cases, leading to overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums.

Some EU countries have already implemented testing requirements, despite earlier advice suggesting it was unjustified. The EU's Integrated Political Crisis Response group (IPCR), comprised of officials from the EU's 27 governments, has recommended several measures. These include the wearing of face masks by all passengers on flights to and from China, the introduction of random testing for flights from China, and conducting wastewater monitoring at airports.

The European Commission has stated that a majority of member states favor restrictions on Chinese arrivals, leading to France, Spain, and Italy already implementing testing requirements. Germany has been monitoring the situation, while England, which is outside the EU, has mandated pre-flight testing for arrivals from China starting Thursday. It is unclear whether an EU-wide policy will be introduced, as individual states can determine their own policies.

The IPCR's recommendation represents a change in direction from the advice given by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) last week, which advised against mandatory Covid testing. The ECDC argued that testing was unnecessary due to high vaccination rates in Europe and the presence of variants circulating within the EU that originated from China.

The World Health Organization (WHO) stated that there is currently no evidence of new variants in China despite the surge in cases. However, experts have cautioned that this may be due to a lack of testing and data. The WHO has also noted that China has been underreporting the true impact of Covid in the country, partly because of a narrow definition of Covid-related deaths. Beijing has officially confirmed only 22 deaths since December, whereas analysts estimate much higher numbers, with over two million daily Covid cases and 14,700 deaths according to the UK science data company Airfinity.

The Chinese government has suggested that travel restrictions on Chinese arrivals are politically motivated and has warned of potential retaliation.",health
4,"Experts have informed the BBC that the current surge of Covid cases in China is unlikely to impact India, but they emphasize the importance of remaining cautious and wearing masks.

India has increased surveillance following a spike in cases in neighboring China. Individuals traveling from China and four other Asian countries are now required to provide a negative Covid-19 test report before entering India. In preparation for a surge, drills were conducted to assess the capacity of hospitals.

According to government data, India currently has around 3,400 active coronavirus cases. However, reports of the surge in China and the memory of two deadly Covid waves in 2020 and 2021 have raised concerns among many people.

Experts reassure the public that there is no reason to worry at this moment. Dr. Chandrakant Lahariya, an epidemiologist and health systems specialist, explains that the surge in infections in China is expected when a susceptible population is not exposed to the virus. He emphasizes that nothing has changed for the rest of the world, including India.

China has been grappling with a surge in Covid cases after moving away from its previous ""zero-Covid"" approach, which involved strict lockdowns, quarantines, and closed borders. The country is now striving to accelerate vaccinations for its vulnerable elderly population as the surge strains healthcare systems. Some experts have raised concerns about whether the main vaccines used in China, Sinovac and Sinopharm, can provide long-term immunity.

Dr. Jacob John, a virologist, explains that people are getting infected because the Omicron subvariant known as BF.7, which is driving the surge in China, is highly infectious and can evade previous immunity. He notes that individuals without immunity are at greater risk, particularly the elderly and immunosuppressed populations.

India has reported four Covid-19 cases caused by BF.7 in recent months, and all patients have recovered, according to health officials. Dr. Lalit Kant, an epidemiologist, states that while Covid is still present, it has become similar to another upper respiratory tract infection like influenza.

The low caseload in India can be largely attributed to the immunity gained over the past three years. Dr. A Fathahudeen, a critical care expert, explains that India's ""hybrid immunity wall"" against Covid-19 is satisfactory, as a majority of people have either received two vaccine doses or gained natural immunity from prior infections. He also highlights that the vaccines used in India are more effective than those used in China.

To further enhance immunity, Dr. Fathahudeen recommends people to take the booster dose if they haven't already done so. Currently, only around 27% of the population has received the booster dose. Experts generally agree with this appeal and stress the benefits of receiving a third shot, particularly for individuals above 60 years of age and those at high risk.

The government's decision to increase genome sequencing, allowing for the identification of new variants, is also supported by experts. Dr. John states that the current testing strategy of random genome sequencing of 2% of international travelers is sufficient to detect any new variant.

Experts urge the government and individuals to adopt a mindset of expecting the best while preparing for the worst. They recommend wearing masks in crowded places, such as during sports events or on crowded buses and trains. Dr. John emphasizes the need for long-term, sustainable behavioral changes. Earlier this year, India relaxed its mask-wearing rules due to a decline in infection levels, but experts now advise caution and adherence to mask-wearing, especially in crowded areas.

In conclusion, experts advise the public to remain cautious, wear masks, and stay informed about the latest news regarding the Covid situation. They also discourage unnecessary crowding and suggest wearing masks when large gatherings cannot be avoided.",health
5,"According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospitals in China are reportedly filling up amid concerns of a new wave of Covid-19 hitting the country. Dr. Michael Ryan states that intensive care units (ICUs) are busy, despite officials claiming that case numbers are ""relatively low"". There is skepticism about the true impact of the disease, as China's figures show no Covid-related deaths on Wednesday. However, recent reports indicate that hospitals in Beijing and other cities have been experiencing a surge in admissions due to the latest Covid outbreak.

Since 2020, China has implemented strict health restrictions as part of its zero Covid policy. However, most of these measures were lifted two weeks ago after significant protests against the strict controls. Since then, the number of cases has sharply risen, raising concerns about the high mortality rate among the elderly, who are particularly vulnerable.

Despite the official figures indicating a low number of Covid deaths, WHO emergencies chief Dr. Ryan urges China to provide more information about the current spread of the virus. He notes that although reported ICU cases are low, there are anecdotal reports of ICUs filling up. The highly infectious nature of the virus makes it difficult to completely stop its spread through public health and social measures alone.

During a weekly news conference in Geneva, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expresses his deep concern over the evolving situation in China. He calls for specific data on disease severity, hospital admissions, and intensive care requirements to be shared.

Dr. Ryan emphasizes that vaccination is the key strategy to combat coronavirus outbreaks. China has developed and produced its own vaccines, which have shown to be less effective in preventing serious Covid illness and death compared to mRNA vaccines used in other parts of the world.

In related news, the German government has announced that it sent its first batch of BioNTech Covid-19 vaccines to China. These vaccines will initially be administered to expats in China, estimated to be around 20,000 individuals. This marks the first delivery of a foreign Covid-19 vaccine to China, although no specific details have been released regarding the delivery size or timing. During a visit to Beijing, Chancellor Olaf Scholz had urged for the vaccine to be made freely available to Chinese citizens.",health
6,"In the town of Taveta, located near the border with Tanzania in Kenya's Taita Hills, families gathered at a local health clinic. They were waiting to hear from Lea Kilenga Bey, who asked if anyone had sickle cell. In response, they all shouted that they either carry the genetic mutation or are caring for someone who does. Taveta, with a population of 22,000, has one of the highest rates of sickle cell disease in Kenya, affecting nearly one in four residents.

Sickle cell disease causes the red blood cells, which are normally round, to have a crescent or sickle shape. This leads to a reduced ability to transport oxygen throughout the body, resulting in severe pain episodes that can last for weeks. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), two-thirds of people affected by sickle cell worldwide live in African countries. It is the most prevalent genetically acquired disease in the region, and child mortality rates are high, with more than half of children born with sickle cell dying before the age of five.

Lea Kilenga Bey, who was diagnosed with sickle cell at six months old and is now in her 30s, founded the Africa Sickle Cell organization in 2017 to improve the lives of people with the disease. She returned to Taveta, her hometown, to raise awareness and dispel myths and misconceptions surrounding sickle cell, which some communities attribute to ancestral curses or witchcraft. Access to medicine is a major challenge for individuals with sickle cell in Taveta and other towns across Kenya. Daily treatment, including antibiotics, blood cell medications, and dietary supplements, is necessary for managing the disease. However, many people cannot afford the expensive medications and must choose between buying medicine or food.

Ms Bey has experienced sickle cell crises firsthand and recorded video diaries to raise awareness about the excruciating pain caused by the disease. In Taveta, she joined a group of people protesting at the local hospital, demanding better treatment and medication. Expired medicine and lack of proper medical care have led to the loss of lives in the community. As a result of advocacy efforts by Albert Loghwaru and Lea Kilenga Bey, a joint haemophilia and sickle clinic was established in Taveta, the first in Taita Taveta county. However, the struggle for better care and support for individuals with sickle cell continues.

Ms Bey emphasizes that their work has just begun, comparing it to a relay race rather than a marathon. The focus is on continuing efforts to improve the lives of people with sickle cell and ensure access to necessary treatment and support for the community.",health
7,"A panel of US medical experts is recommending that women start preventative breast cancer screening a decade earlier than current guidelines suggest. They propose initiating mammograms at age 40 and having regular screenings every two years. The draft guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) are currently undergoing review. Previous recommendations advised most women to begin screening at age 50.

The task force, composed of doctors and disease experts who evaluate research on disease prevention, claims that if the new recommendations are adopted, they could save the lives of an additional 19% of American women. Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women in the United States, and nearly 13% of American women will receive a breast cancer diagnosis during their lifetime.

The new screening guidelines are particularly significant for black women, who are reported to be ""40% more likely to die from breast cancer than white women,"" according to the task force's statement. Dr. Wanda Nicholson, Vice Chair of the USPSTF, emphasized that while ensuring black women start screening at age 40 is an important first step, it alone is insufficient to address the health disparities related to breast cancer.

The proposed draft guidelines are intended for women at average risk for breast cancer or those with a family history of the disease. They also include women with other risk factors, such as dense breast tissue, which can increase the risk of cancer and make it more challenging to detect using mammograms. However, these guidelines would not apply to women with a genetic risk of breast cancer, such as those carrying the BRCA1 genetic mutation.",health
8,"Kristan Hawkins, the founder of Students for Life of America (SFLA), has become a prominent figure in the anti-abortion movement in the United States. She started her journey as an activist when she was 15, volunteering at a crisis pregnancy center and becoming deeply committed to the pro-life cause. Over the years, she has grown SFLA into one of the largest anti-abortion organizations in the country, with a focus on training and mobilizing young activists on college campuses.

Hawkins is known for her relentless dedication and unyielding approach. She played a significant role in the push for stricter abortion laws after the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. Under her leadership, SFLA has been instrumental in advocating for anti-abortion bills in various state legislatures. These efforts have led to the restriction or unavailability of abortion for millions of women, sparking public health concerns.

While Hawkins and her organization have been successful in advancing their agenda, they face opposition from pro-choice advocates and even some Republicans who believe their approach is extreme. Hawkins has set her sights on achieving a federal abortion ban, starting at conception, which goes against public opinion that generally supports access to legal abortion.

Hawkins' strategy of pushing for early abortion bans at six weeks of pregnancy reflects a departure from the incremental approach favored by other anti-abortion groups. Her outspokenness and refusal to compromise on exceptions for rape and incest, as well as her opposition to certain forms of birth control, have drawn criticism from both pro-choice activists and more moderate Republicans.

Despite the divisions within the anti-abortion movement and the political challenges ahead, Hawkins remains determined to pursue her goal. She is willing to challenge politicians who do not align with her strict pro-life stance and believes that the movement should continue to push for increasingly extreme measures in the absence of Roe v. Wade.

Hawkins' uncompromising approach has solidified her influence among anti-abortion activists, even as public opinion and electoral dynamics shift in favor of abortion rights. As the movement moves further to the right, she is seen as a driving force behind its shift toward more extreme abortion bans.",health
9,"Since the US Supreme Court's Dobbs decision ended 50 years of protected access to abortions in the United States, parents of teens and preteens are finding themselves in the position of having to have more detailed conversations with their children about reproductive health and birth control. The changing legal landscape around reproductive healthcare has raised concerns and a sense of urgency among parents, who are now discussing topics such as renting out-of-state post office boxes, using public WiFi, and deleting personal details from phone apps to ensure privacy and avoid tracking.

One mother, referred to as Christine, expressed shock and concern after the Dobbs decision became official. She felt the need to protect her children and had discussions with her teenage son and his friend about the increased risks and responsibilities associated with sexual activity. Christine emphasized the potential need for funds to cover travel expenses for out-of-state abortions and stressed the importance of making responsible choices.

Another parent, Adam, and his wife in Louisiana, discussed birth control options for their 15-year-old daughter earlier than planned due to concerns about potential restrictions on birth control access. They decided to get their daughter an intrauterine device (IUD) to provide long-acting contraception. They felt that their choices had been limited and wanted to ensure their daughter's future was not derailed.

The changing landscape of reproductive health care also affects access for teens who cannot discuss birth control with their parents. Programs like Title X, which provide family planning services to low-income patients and adolescents, have been crucial in providing access to birth control. However, these programs are now under threat, leaving some teenagers with limited options.

In Texas, for example, minors need parental consent to access birth control, even if they are already parents themselves. Title X clinics used to provide free and confidential contraception, but a recent ruling deemed it a violation of parental rights and state law. This has further restricted access for teenagers in Texas.

The Dobbs decision and related changes in reproductive health care have led parents to engage in more open and direct discussions about sexual health with their children. They are taking proactive measures to ensure access to contraception and protect their children's future.",health
10,"For the past decade, highly effective medications for hepatitis C have been available but have not been widely accessible in the United States, leading to significant disparities in treatment. These direct-acting antiviral drugs have been hailed as major medical breakthroughs, with a cure rate of 95% and minimal side effects. However, the high cost of these drugs, which were initially priced at around $90,000 for a course of treatment, has made them unaffordable for many patients.

A recent study published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report highlights the disparities in access to hepatitis C therapies. The study analyzed data from Quest Diagnostics and found that only one in three Americans diagnosed with hepatitis C were cured over the past decade. Cure rates varied depending on factors such as age and insurance coverage, with younger patients and those with little or no insurance being less likely to be cured compared to older patients and those with better insurance coverage.

The study also revealed that the demographics of hepatitis C infections have shifted, with adults under 40 now being the group most likely to be infected. This increase is primarily driven by the rise in injected drug use. The low cure rates and increasing number of cases highlight the need for improved access to treatment and better awareness of the disease.

Despite efforts to increase screening and testing for hepatitis C, many doctors and patients are still unaware of the recommendations. The testing process itself can be complicated and time-consuming, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation. The cost of treatment remains a significant barrier, even though prices have come down to around $24,000 for a course of treatment in the US. However, in countries like Egypt, the cost has been significantly reduced to $85 per person by authorizing generic versions of the drugs.

The high cost of treatment has resulted in insurance plans implementing barriers to access, such as requiring proof of liver damage or sobriety before covering the drugs. These requirements go against national treatment recommendations and impede timely access to care. Efforts to negotiate subscription services with drug companies, known as the ""Netflix model,"" have been successful in some states and have expanded access to treatment. However, implementing such models nationwide will require significant investment and political will.

Addressing the barriers to hepatitis C treatment is crucial to prevent further liver damage, transmission of the infection, and related complications like liver failure and liver cancer. Advocacy for affordable and accessible treatment options, improved awareness and education, and policy changes are necessary to eliminate the disparities in hepatitis C care and achieve the goal of eliminating the disease by 2030.",health
11,"The Biden administration has identified fentanyl laced with xylazine, an animal sedative known as ""tranq,"" as an emerging threat in the United States. A new analysis of toxicology reports reveals a significant increase in the presence of xylazine in fentanyl overdose deaths. In June 2022, xylazine was detected in nearly 11% of fentanyl overdose deaths, compared to about 3% in January 2019.

The data, published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is based on a subset of states that participated in the CDC's State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System. The researchers acknowledge that reporting practices have varied, and increased prevalence may partially reflect greater awareness and testing. However, consistent testing for xylazine is needed to understand the true extent of the issue.

Xylazine is not an opioid but is used as a tranquilizer in veterinary medicine. It is not approved for use in humans and can cause severe damage, including skin ulcers, soft-tissue wounds, and necrosis. The reason behind the tissue wounds caused by xylazine is not yet understood, but experts suggest that additives in the drugs may contribute to these effects.

The report indicates that fatal fentanyl overdoses, with or without xylazine, share similar circumstances and characteristics. Naloxone, the overdose-reversal medication, is not effective for xylazine overdoses since it is not an opioid. However, naloxone was administered in about a quarter of cases involving xylazine. When xylazine was not present, individuals were more likely to have no pulse by the time first responders arrived.

The majority of fentanyl overdoses involving xylazine occurred in the Northeast, particularly in Maryland, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. In these states, xylazine was present in about a quarter of all fentanyl overdose deaths, twice the national rate. The prevalence of xylazine in fentanyl varied depending on the region and the form of the drug seized.

Further investigation is needed to understand the effects of xylazine on humans and why it is sought out in drug use. Clinicians are currently providing naloxone and oxygenation as immediate interventions, but additional treatment options are being explored. The rise of xylazine in fentanyl-related deaths highlights the need for prevention strategies and further research to address this emerging threat.",health
12,"The United States is experiencing a particularly severe tick season, leading experts to emphasize the importance of personal precautions to prevent tick-borne diseases. Diagnoses of Lyme disease, a bacterial infection transmitted by blacklegged ticks or deer ticks, were 17% higher in the first week of June compared to the previous year. The data, collected by athenahealth, represents a significant increase in the past three weeks, with the seasonal peak expected to occur just before the Fourth of July holiday.

Ticks, particularly blacklegged ticks, are considered a significant public health threat as they can transmit various diseases to humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tracks multiple species of ticks and at least seven pathogens they can spread. Cases of babesiosis, another tick-borne disease that can be fatal, have also been on the rise, growing 25% from 2011 to 2019.

Several factors contribute to the increased risk of tick-borne diseases. The habitat of ticks, including blacklegged ticks and Lone Star ticks, is expanding further into the Northeast, Midwest, and Middle Atlantic states. Additionally, changing human habitats, such as reforestation and population movement into tick-prone areas, create environments suitable for tick hosts. Warmer weather also extends the tick lifecycle, increasing their opportunities to find hosts and spread diseases.

The nymph stage of the blacklegged tick, which occurs from late May to early July, poses a particular risk to humans. Nymph ticks, as small as a poppy seed, may already be carrying diseases from their previous hosts. Increased awareness of tick-borne diseases may contribute to the rise in Lyme disease diagnoses. Experts urge both doctors and patients to be vigilant and pay attention to symptoms, which can include fever, headache, and joint pain.

Controlling the tick population is challenging, making personal precautions crucial. Tick prevention measures, such as wearing protective clothing, using tick repellents, and checking for ticks after potential exposure, are recommended. Prompt removal of ticks within the first 24 hours of attachment is crucial to reduce the risk of disease transmission.",health
13,"Public health officials in Texas and Florida have reported no new cases of locally acquired malaria following a national alert. The Texas Department of State Health Services is aware of only one case in the state, and no infected mosquitoes have been found. Similarly, the Florida Department of Health has not reported any new cases, and all four individuals previously diagnosed with malaria have recovered.

Malaria is typically imported into the United States when someone travels to a country where the disease is more prevalent. However, these recent cases mark the first instances of locally acquired malaria in the US in the past 20 years. The Texas case involved an individual who did not have recent overseas travel history but had been working outdoors in Cameron County.

Both state health departments are actively monitoring the situation, conducting mosquito surveillance, and coordinating with local health departments. The Florida Department of Health has issued advisories and reminders for the public to take precautions against mosquito bites, especially during the Fourth of July holiday.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasizes that the risk of locally acquired malaria in the US remains extremely low. The CDC is collaborating with health departments in Florida and Texas to investigate these cases but has found no evidence linking them. The agency advises against testing mosquitoes for Plasmodium outside the affected areas, as there is no indication of higher risk in other regions.",health
14,"A new report from the nonprofit organization Truth Initiative reveals that residents of 12 states in the South and Midwest, referred to as ""Tobacco Nation,"" are more likely to smoke and smoke more heavily compared to individuals in the rest of the United States. These states include Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and West Virginia.

Despite comprising only 21% of the US population, Tobacco Nation is home to 28% of the country's smokers. The prevalence of smoking in these states is approximately 50% higher than the national average, with 19% of adults smoking compared to 13% in other states. This pattern is also observed among young adults, where 11% in Tobacco Nation smoke compared to less than 8% in other states. Additionally, teenagers in these states have a higher likelihood of smoking.

The report highlights weaker local policies on tobacco prevention and cessation in Tobacco Nation as a significant factor contributing to the disparity. The influence of the tobacco industry and lack of political will from decision-makers play a role in these states' limited efforts to address smoking prevalence. For instance, while federal data indicates a historic low in adult smoking rates, e-cigarette usage has increased in popularity. While hundreds of local governments across the country have enacted laws restricting the sale of flavored tobacco, only three of those measures have been implemented in the 12 states with higher smoking prevalence.

Moreover, the report reveals that smokers in Tobacco Nation consume significantly more cigarettes than smokers in other states. On average, an individual in Tobacco Nation consumes approximately 53 packs per year, compared to an average of 29 packs in the rest of the US, amounting to around 500 more cigarettes per person annually.

Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable disease, disability, and death in the United States, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke lead to nearly half a million premature deaths annually and cause severe illnesses in millions more.

The report emphasizes the importance of implementing stronger actions and policies to address these geographic disparities, improve public health, and promote smoke-free lives in Tobacco Nation. It underscores the negative impact of tobacco use, including shorter life expectancy, worse health indicators, and higher tobacco use rates in these states.",health
15,"A new case of HIV has been linked to a ""vampire facial"" procedure at an Albuquerque spa that closed in 2018, according to the New Mexico Department of Health. The patient reported that the only potential HIV risk was the vampire facial received at VIP Beauty Salon and Spa in 2018. Two previous cases of HIV were also associated with injection-related procedures at the same spa in 2019. In response, the Department of Health has reopened its investigation into the spa and is recommending that former clients who received injection-related services, such as vampire facials or Botox, undergo testing for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. The state health department previously conducted testing for over 100 spa clients during the initial investigation, and it advises former clients to be retested even if they previously tested negative. The spa had been closed in 2018 due to unsafe practices that could potentially spread blood-borne infections. The owner of the spa pleaded guilty to five felony counts of practicing medicine without a license in June 2022. A vampire facial involves injecting plasma, typically derived from the patient's own blood, into the skin using a micro-needling pen.

26,"Mark Cavendish is out of the Tour de France after crashing during stage eight on Saturday.

The Manxman, 38, had already said this Tour would be his last as he plans to retire at the end of the season.

Widely regarded as cycling's greatest sprinter of all time, Cavendish came into this year's Tour level on 34 stage wins with Belgian legend Eddy Merckx.

Jasper Philipsen denied Cavendish a record breaking 35th stage win during stage seven on Friday.

Cavendish was involved in an innocuous crash with Pello Bilbao 60km from the finish of Saturday's 200.7km transitional stage between Libourne and Limoges.

He suffered a suspected broken collarbone and went into an ambulance, with his team Astana Qazaqstan confirming he was forced to abandon the race.

The Tour added Heartbreaking for the Manx Missile. 

Cavendish is the fifth rider to abandon this year's Tour after Enric Mas, Richard Carapaz, Jacopo Guarnieri and Luis Leon Sanchez, with all those withdrawals due to crashes.

It marks the seventh time from 14 appearances that Cavendish, who made his Tour debut in 2007, has not finished the race.

After a two year absence, and having not won a Tour stage since 2016, he returned in 2021 to win four and move level with five time Tour winner Merckx.",sports
27,"Lee Carsley has urged his England Under 21 side to take their chance at European Championship glory because his players can't get this time back after their final against Spain on Saturday.

The match at Georgia's Batumi Arena marks the end of a two year cycle for Carsley's side, with many of his players no longer eligible to play U21 football once the final whistle blows.

 We've spoken about this literally being a moment in time and that it's going to pass quickly, said Carsley.

 It's making the most of now and trying to encourage them that they can't get this time back. Whether we've done well or not, this time we've had now, we're not going to get it back.

 It's about trying to remove the pressure and let them enjoy the experience.

 I always think that if you give the players that feeling of responsibility and ownership, then they are more than likely to perform because they feel part of what we're trying to do. 

England U21s on brink of first Euros win since 1984
James Trafford From farm to the final, is this England's future number one?
How did England's 1984 winners do afterwards?
The Young Lions have been widely praised for the exciting football they have played during this tournament.

England are also yet to concede a goal in the competition and the possibility of winning the trophy has started a discussion about how this could be one of the best generations of young players to come through the English pathway.

 I think the fact that they've got this far in the tournament would suggest that, said Carsley.

 It's three age groups coming together the previous 21s, the 20s and some of the 19s. So creating a good atmosphere and dynamic within that squad and their personalities was important.

 A lot of them are vying for the same position and have played against each other for a while now. So it's about getting that mix right. 

'I don't see this as a beginning, middle or end'
Carsley's own future has been a talking point heading into this tournament, with the 50 year old on a rolling contract and ongoing speculation he could leave his role at the end of the Championships.

 I don't see this as a beginning, middle or end, he said.

 It was more important for me that the players had a really good experience that was the biggest thing.

 I don't see this as a step to somewhere else. I see this as making sure I can do a good job, and being as well prepared as I can be. I tried three or four years ago not to look too far ahead on what's next I did as a player, massively, I was always constantly thinking about it.

 I try to avoid that as a coach. I'm not looking at these players as a springboard the opposite to that. The most important thing to me is they perform well in the final and show what they can do. 

If England do manage to beat Spain, it would be the first time the Young Lions have won this competition since 1984.

 The team have got maybe two or three levels to go, said Carsley. If they click it'll be a hell of a performance tomorrow.

 The bigger the stage you'll see a different intensity to the team. I'm looking forward to it. ",sports
28,"Whenever Andy Murray waves goodbye to Centre Court these days, nobody can confidently predict if it will be the last time or not.

In the hours after another disheartening defeat in the second round at Wimbledon, even the 36 year old was unsure.

At the start of the 10th anniversary of Murray's iconic first title at the All England Club, when he ended Britain's 77 year wait for a men's singles champion, there was hope.

The hope was that he could complete a memorable win over Greek fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas and earn his most notable victory at a Grand Slam since having career saving hip surgery in 2019.

By the end of the day, the former world number one questioned whether all the effort, pain and sacrifice of trying to go deep at Wimbledon was worth repeating.

Asked if he was confident of returning next year, Murray said: I don't know. Motivation is obviously a big thing.

 Continuing having early losses in tournaments like this doesn't necessarily help with that. 

Murray cut a forlorn figure as he spoke to journalists, looking incredibly downbeat as he dissected his five set defeat by 24 year old Tsitsipas.

The scene was nothing new. Revealing raw emotion after difficult defeats at the place where he puts the greatest emphasis on winning has been common in the past few years.

In 2021, Murray said he needed to weigh up if all the hard work is worth it after an encouraging run was ended by Canada's Denis Shapovalov in the third round.

In 2022, an equally despondent Murray also questioned his future after suffering his earliest exit at Wimbledon at the hands of American John Isner in the second round.

This year, for all the bullish talk in the build up, the tournament ended with the same result.

 Losing in the second round, I don't find that motivating. It's not why I put all of the work in, said Murray, who has not reached the fourth round of a major since Wimbledon in 2017.

 It's similar to last year, I guess. I had a long think about things, spoke to my family, and decided to keep on going.

 I'm unbelievably disappointed and upset now. Maybe I will feel different in a few days but right now it doesn't feel good. 

This summer, Murray has channelled all his efforts into a deep run at the place where he has won two of his three major titles.

That is what makes the disappointment even harder to take.

Murray decided to skip the clay court French Open, preferring instead to start his preparations on the British grass on which he thrives.

Dropping down to the ATP Challenger Tour the level below the main tour led to title wins in Surbiton and Nottingham.

Murray suffered a chastening defeat against Alex de Minaur when he made the step up in class at Queen's. Nothing to panic about, he insisted.

But, crucially, it meant he missed out on a seeding and left him open to the prospect of facing one of the highest ranked players in the first two rounds.

The draw threw up a potential second round match against Tsitsipas a two time major finalist tipped to win one of the sport's biggest prizes sooner rather than later.

When that highly anticipated meeting panned out, Murray stepped up to the occasion as he regularly does on the big stage and showed glimpses of his best.

It was testament to his performance that Tsitsipas had to produce his best display on grass in a long time to pull through.

Not even that could soften the blow for Murray, who knows he can still mix it with the world's best.

 I certainly can. It's clear based on how the match went. There was only a few points in it, he said.

 But it's not just about winning the odd match against them really. To have a run at these tournaments, you need multiple, multiple wins in a row. I've not done that. 

Murray is not the type of player to rush into any major decisions and his love for the game is evident by the depths from which he has recovered to continue playing.

Last weekend, Murray said he had an idea in my head about when he wanted to retire. That decision does not look imminent but the scars of this latest Wimbledon loss may lead to reassessment.

Tim Henman, Murray's former Davis Cup team mate and long time friend, believes the Scot will reflect more positively when the dust is settled .

 Andy has got a wise head on slightly older shoulders now and he is absolutely right not to commit to anything, he said.

 He will reflect on how much effort he has put in this year. He dropped down levels to play in Challenger events and to win two on grass. That emphasises the hunger and desire.

 That desire still burns bright and I really hope there is more to come for Andy. ",sports
29,"Former Manchester United and Ajax goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar's condition is stable but still concerning following a bleed on his brain, his family says.

The 52 year old was taken to an intensive care unit on Friday.

He will remain in intensive care for the time being said Ajax in a statement on behalf of his wife.

He is reportedly being treated in a hospital in Croatia, where he was on holiday.

The former Netherlands international, who won 130 caps for his country, resigned from his role as Ajax chief executive in May after the side finished third in the Dutch league and failed to qualify for the Champions League for the first time since 2009.

He retired from playing after leaving United in 2011 before joining the Ajax board in 2012, and later becoming the club's chief executive in 2016.

Van der Sar made 266 appearances for the Red Devils and helped them to win four Premier League titles and the 2008 Champions League.

He also played in the Premier League for Fulham and in Serie A for Juventus.

His former clubs and teammates are among those sending their support to Van der Sar.

The Van der Sar family, along with Ajax, is grateful and deeply touched by the many messages of support, Ajax said.

Football world rooting for Van der Sar analysis
Simon Stone, BBC Sport's senior football reporter

Football is united in hoping Van der Sar makes a full recovery.

First as a superb goalkeeper with Ajax, Juventus, Fulham and Manchester United, plus the Dutch national team then as an administrator, at Ajax and with the influential European Clubs' Association, he has developed a first rate reputation.

I spoke to him in Istanbul, on the day of last month's Champions League final, when he talked about Andre Onana's likely influence on the game, Erik ten Hag's time at Manchester United and also his future plans.

Van der Sar endured a difficult final season with Ajax but, despite leaving the club, gave the impression of someone not intent on staying out of the game for long.

Through the recovery of his wife Annemarie, who suffered a brain haemorrhage when he was a player at United in 2009 and Sir Alex Ferguson, who collapsed in 2018, there are positive examples to reflect on in this uncertain time.

Football is worried on Van der Sar's behalf. There are many good wishes being extended in public and private as it absorbs this news.",sports
30,"A raft of England's finest former youth players are set to walk out on to the world stage this month, but not all will represent the Lionesses. Some will play for the land of their parents or grandparents after opting to switch sporting nationality.

BBC Sport has spoken to Tottenham pair Rosella Ayane and Becky Spencer and Leicester City's Ashleigh Plumptre about that bold decision and its consequences.

Part of the family
When Morocco secured their first ever Women's World Cup place last year, Spurs forward Ayane had to get on a chair and make good on an earlier promise.

The first English player from the Women's Super League to represent the Atlas Lionesses, she had changed sporting allegiance from England the year before but was yet to perform her initiation song.

Pressed to deliver at the start of the Women's Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon), Ayane had put her new teammates off, insisting they grab that World Cup ticket with a top four finish first.

 They didn't forget, she laughs. The minute we got into the hotel after we'd qualified, they made me stand up on the chair and I sang my little heart out.

 I picked an Adele song that everyone knew and they embraced it, they joined in and it showed how much they want me to be a part of that family. 

Rosella Ayane playing for England Under 19s in 2013
Rosella Ayane played for England at under 17 and under 19 level
Born in Reading to a Scottish mum and Moroccan dad, 27 year old Ayane was raised in England's youth system alongside current Lionesses Leah Williamson and Katie Zelem.

But with no senior caps by 2021, and with Morocco having twice reached out, she chose to fulfill her still burning international ambitions with the Atlas Lionesses.

 I was very honored, she says. And not only did it feel right football wise, it felt right mentally for the place I was at. 

Unable to speak French or Arabic and knowing neither the players nor head coach Reynald Pedros, her switch was, nevertheless, a step outside her comfort zone.

 I really respect the way they've taken me in, she says. I'm from a completely different culture, speak a completely different language and it would be quite easy for them to isolate me, but they do the exact opposite. 

Rosella Ayane celebrates during Morocco's semifinal with Nigeria
Rosella Ayane scored the winning penalty to send Morocco into the Afcon final
Ayane repaid them by letting her football do the talking her crucial winning spot kick against Nigeria took the Atlas Lionesses to their first Afcon final and she netted again in the 2 1 loss to South Africa in the showpiece.

In May, she won a Moroccans of the World award for her sporting exploits and, with a World Cup in the offing, her decision to switch is a personal triumph.

Yet looking back on a campaign during which thousands of Moroccans took the players to their hearts, Ayane sees a bigger picture.

 I think we are starting to change the dynamic, the respect and the view of women's football in Morocco, she says. If we can change the perspective of a country and help inspire the next generation, that for me is an achievement I'll be forever proud of. 

Jamaica accept me for who I am
Londoner Spencer, whose dad is Jamaican, also switched from England in 2021 and the move has revitalized her.

 I had toyed with retiring before this, says the 32 year old Tottenham keeper. Now I've picked it back up and it's motivated me again to go on for a few more years. 

A Champions League winner with Arsenal in 2007, Spencer has long been a familiar face in the top flight and has made more than 100 WSL appearances.

She was England's number one at the 2008 Under 20 Women's World Cup, and the following year was unbeaten in their tournament victory at the Under 19 European Championship alongside Lucy Bronze, Laura Coombs, Jordan Nobbs and Demi Stokes.

Senior call ups followed but Spencer remained uncapped so concentrated on her club form and media work instead.

 I didn't think about it and I wasn't missing it, she says. I was actually quite exhausted because when you do that from such a young age you don't know any different. 

An approach from Jamaica reignited her interest though and, after keeping a clean sheet on her debut against Nigeria in 2021, the WSL stalwart felt accepted by the Reggae Girlz for who I was and the player that I am .

Becky Spencer playing for Jamaica
Becky Spencer says the decision to play for Jamaica has motivated her to continue her career
Two head coaches have departed Jamaica since, and the players recently criticized their federation for its subpar support before this World Cup.

Speaking prior to that, Spencer said: There's not a lot of money in that federation so with that you don't know what to expect, but we've got a very good core of players that stick together. 

Among them is Spurs midfielder Drew Spence, 30, who also switched from England, and the two friends contributed to the victories that secured Jamaica's return to the world stage.

Now Spencer hopes the team's visibility at this World Cup will inspire Jamaica's future players and their nation.

 They love us over there, she adds. So we hope we can do them proud. 

A journey to self understanding
Leicester City defender Plumptre will never forget her debut for Nigeria against Ivory Coast in 2022. Returning to her hotel afterward, she burst into tears.

 I'd been holding so much emotion back for so long, she says. This was something I'd been waiting to do for a long time and it was huge for my family. 

It was also a big moment for former England youth player Plumptre, who had changed sporting nationality to the birthplace of her grandfather the previous year.

 I had a lot of people questioning why I chose Nigeria over England, she says. Playing with Nigeria is part of this journey that I'm on. It's not necessarily football, it's a life journey.

Ashleigh Plumptre celebrates a win with Nigeria
Ashleigh Plumptre helped Nigeria to a 2 0 win over Ivory Coast on her debut
Born in Leicester, 25 year old Plumptre enjoyed great experiences with England in two European Under 17 Championships alongside future Euro 2022 stars Chloe Kelly and Alessia Russo.

But she started to consider her connections to Nigeria after frank lockdown chats with her younger half sister about racism, their African heritage, and a culture neither really knew.

Reaching out to the Super Falcons was her next step, although Plumptre was initially so overawed by her teammates she got off the bus without daring to speak to Barcelona's star striker Asisat Oshoala.

Stepping up during a tricky Afcon campaign that saw Nigeria lose their continental crown but qualify for a ninth World Cup, the calm and composed defender earned the right to be among them out in Australia.

 This was something that was never an aim of mine when I first joined Nigeria, she says. But being on the qualifying journey with the team to get here has taught me so much and given me amazing life experiences. ",sports
31,"A big hitter, with an aggressive game built around her forehand, Boulter is a popular player with the home fans and is the only Briton left in either singles draw following the exits of Andy Murray, Cameron Norrie and Liam Broady on Friday.

Boulter claimed an emotional victory over former world number one Pliskova on Centre Court last year and is aiming to channel those memories against Rybakina.

 I think I've got the whole thing in my memory, to be honest with you, Boulter said.

 I still think about the time that I served it out. That's something that I draw on.

 I'm already excited to play against a top player and have a go. I think they're the moments I get excited for. 

Rybakina has had a shaky start to her title defence, having to fight back from a set down in her opener and looking unsure at times in her second round win over Alize Cornet.

A more subdued figure on court than Boulter, the Australian Open runner up is not worried about the home crowd support her opponent will receive.

 The crowd won't be supporting me that much. I'm sure it's going to be good, she added.

 She's a tough player and her game is aggressive. It's going to be a tough one. ",sports
32,"Alcaraz and Djokovic are the top seeds and could meet in the final on 16 July.
Wawrinka, 38, is a three time Grand Slam winner, beating Djokovic in two of those finals the 2015 French Open and 2016 US Open but had said he had zero hopes of winning the tournament and no chance of beating 36 year old Djokovic.
The Serb dominated the opening two sets, winning them in a total of 67 minutes, dropping only four games while doing so, but Warwrinka produced a better performance in the third set.
Djokovic, who is aiming to equal Roger Federer's men's record of eight titles, ensured his match would not go into extra time as he fought back from 5 3 down in the tie break to advance into the last 16.
 We are two old guys fighting with the young guns, said Djokovic. We have had some amazing battles on the biggest courts. I respect him as a player and he is a really nice guy so I wish him all the best for the rest of the season.
 He was only two points away from extending the match to another day. One of us had to win in straight sets [for it to end on Friday] and it looked very good in the first two sets.
 He then raised his level and I dropped mine, the crowd got involved and it was a good atmosphere.
 I know I have a couple of gears that I can go to as the tournament progresses. 
This is Alcaraz's third year of playing at Wimbledon and in 2021 he won on court six, before losing on Court One. His three wins in 2022 included two victories on Court One and another success on court two ahead before losing to Jannik Sinner in the last 16 on Centre Court.
He won his opener this year on Court One on Tuesday, with this win over Muller surely the first of many on the sport's most famous stage.
 It's something I wanted to enjoy every single second of and I did, said Alcaraz. I'm playing at a great level, getting more experience and getting better each match. 
Alcaraz struggled early on, repeatedly sending forehands from the baseline long and that gave Muller three break points early on, but he was unable to convert them.
The Spaniard showing superb touch, technique and pace of shot gained the vital break in the seventh game.
Alcaraz won the tie break and was untroubled in the third set to set up a meeting with 25th seed Nicolas Jarry of Chile in round three.
Earlier this week, Medvedev, who has never gone past the last 16 at Wimbledon, said he didn't feel at home on grass, and now said: I'm getting there. Maybe at the door. Not inside, but at the door.

LPGA rookie Tardy has 5 missed cuts and withdrawn once in 10 events this season.

Tardy is playing in US Women's Open for 4th time and first since 2017.

34,"Ben Stokes provided yet more heroics and his bowlers crucial late wickets as England desperately battled to keep their Ashes hopes alive on day two of the third Test at Headingley. Stokes' knock meant the tourists' first innings lead was just 26, despite four wickets falling in the morning session including Joe Root with the second ball of the day to Pat Cummins, who claimed 6 91.

The England captain attacked after lunch, launching five sixes and six fours, while Mark Wood helped swing the momentum with 24 from eight balls.

In reply, despite the loss of David Warner for one, the opener again caught off Stuart Broad, Australia eased to 68 1 and a lead of 94 as they threatened to take a firm grip on an enthralling Test.

But Moeen Ali removed Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith in successive overs before Chris Woakes dismissed Usman Khawaja in the final hour for 43.

Travis Head and first innings centurion Mitchell Marsh survived the final 45 minutes to leave the Test, in which a win would seal the series for Australia, finely poised.

England are already attempting to do what they have never done before overturn a 2 0 deficit to win the Ashes and at times on a captivating second day their hopes were fading.

But in Stokes they have a player at his best when his back is against the wall, shown in his incredible 155 in last week's second Test defeat and in his iconic, match winning 135 not out at Headingley in 2019.

England resumed on 68 3 but by lunch they had just three wickets left and were still 121 runs in arrears, only for their captain to almost drag them to parity all while struggling with a glute injury.

That injury prevented Stokes from bowling and, with Ollie Robinson also out of the attack with a back spasm, England were struggling when Khawaja and Labuschagne blunted the new ball.

England stuck to their task, though, on a pitch offering less movement and pace than on day one.

The presence of Marsh and Head, two batters who can score quickly, is a danger, but Headingley is the best Test ground in England to bat in the fourth innings.

In the past three fourth innings chases at the ground 359, 322 and 296 have been made to win, while Leicestershire knocked off 389 here in county cricket earlier this summer.

Stokes fights through the pain

Stokes arrived at the crease when Root got a ball from Cummins that bounced, took the edge and was snaffled by Warner at first slip.

Within the first half hour, Bairstow edged a full ball to Smith from Mitchell Starc when attempting a slashing drive.

Stokes was patient in the morning session, sharing watchful partnership of 44 until Moeen fell into the short ball trap and was caught at fine leg for 19.

The England captain watched from the non striker's end as Woakes was hit on the head by a Starc bouncer, responded by a clubbing another for six but was then inevitably caught behind on the pull via a thin edge.

Wood was the unlikely instigator of England's counter attack. He smacked Starc for six first ball and cleared the rope twice more in eight balls before Stokes flicked the switch.

Again he hogged the strike to put on 32 with number 10 Broad and 38 with last man Robinson as he smashed Ashes debutant Todd Murphy for five sixes, including one huge straight hit into the top tier.

Stokes offered two tough chances in successive balls while on 45 Starc spilling a running catch from long off and spinner Murphy a caught and bowled but was finally dismissed after slicing another heave into the hands of Smith at long on.

Labuschagne & Smith hand England opening

The rate at which England lost wickets and scored runs meant their bowlers had little more than 50 overs of rest before taking to the field again, the injuries only adding to their woe.

But the early boost came when Warner nicked Broad to second slip, the 17th time he has been dismissed by the England seamer in Tests, to leave Australia 11 1.

On 33, Labuschagne offered a chance down the leg side when attempting to pull Wood but, diving one handed, Bairstow spilled his third chance of the match.

England's wicketkeeper would have been relieved when the right hander slog swept his next ball straight into the hands of Harry Brook at deep mid wicket.

If that wicket was an unexpected gift, the next was even more so. Smith, usually immovable, simply clipped Moeen to mid wicket to hand England's off spinner his 200th Test scalp Bairstow sending Smith on his way with a word from behind the stumps.

Wood, who bowled quickly again but slightly slower than on day one, looked exhausted when he made way after a testing spell.

He was replaced by Woakes, who tempted Khawaja into a poke for a crucial late breakthrough courtesy of a decent edge through to Bairstow.

That put England on top but Marsh, more restrained than in the first innings, and left hander Head ensured the Test remains perfectly in the balance.

'A tremendous battle' reaction

BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew on Test Match Special: A fascinating game of cricket, all the players out there have given absolutely everything and it has been a tremendous battle.

 Can England keep the Ashes alive? At the moment, it's well within their grasp. 

England all rounder Moeen Ali: I'm really glad I came back to Test cricket. Playing under Stokes and Brendon even when bowling I don't feel under pressure. The environment is my sort of environment for sure. 

Former England captain Michael Vaughan: It's fantastic to watch, you just don't know which way it is going to sway.

 Ben Stokes is just remarkable whilst there was carnage around him he just had clarity. 

Australia captain Pat Cummins: I'm sure the fans are loving it but I wouldn't mind a stress free day or two. It's all set up for another wonderful match. ",sports
35,"Great Britain's Jazmin Sawyers, who won her first major long jump title at the European indoors in March, will feature in a series of BBC Sport columns in the build up to August's World Athletics Championships in Budapest.

In her second piece, Jazz discusses the need for more women specific sport science research, which could prove career altering for elite athletes and prevent young girls from giving up sport altogether.

Women's sport is growing rapidly in popularity but the science is still lagging behind only about 6% of sports science research is conducted exclusively on female athletes.

As athletes, we automatically jump to the decision that we're not good enough after a poor performance, rather than stopping to consider what is going on inside our own bodies.

The public do the same thing, because that's the norm. It's the way we treat sportspeople in general. The conversation is often around how an athlete failed to handle the occasion when, sometimes, there's a physiological issue.

For me, managing your body is easily one of the hardest aspects of being a female athlete. But this is a conversation for everyone.

After pulling up with cramps at last year's European Championships, 2019 200m world champion Dina Asher Smith called for more research into the effect of periods on performance.

It would be career altering for sportswomen if we knew more.

I would love to see more research about the effects of the menstrual cycle, which could inform how we train, help us to avoid preventable injuries, and teach us how to optimize our performances at major championships.

Women can track their own symptoms, monitor how they feel, try to predict where in the month they can push themselves and when they need to hold back.

But these are things we, as women in the world of professional sport, are still having to figure out for ourselves.

As elite athletes, although we can't influence the level of research being undertaken, what we can do is talk openly about the topic and do our bit to normalize the conversation.

Pain and panic filled the hours before my Olympic debut

In 2017 I was forced to pull out of a competition in Boston because my period pain was so severe. I talked a little bit about it and I was shocked when it became a news story.

It clicked then that this was a conversation we need to have because it shouldn't be a big deal.

To me, it was an important piece of the puzzle to figure out because I didn't feel like I should be that far into my professional career and still have such little knowledge about my cycle.

I wasn't supposed to be coming on my period that day and I physically wasn't able to compete. With better education, I may have been prepared for that situation.

A year earlier, four hours before qualifying began at my first Olympic Games, I was in the doctor's room screaming in pain.

Despite putting a plan in place, testing medication throughout the year to delay my period and allow me to compete unhindered, it had started. I was immobile from the pain and I didn't know what the solution was.

It was pure panic. I thought my Olympic debut was over because I simply couldn't move from the bed.

Eventually I ended up just having a lot of painkillers and I scraped through to the final.

That really shouldn't be the solution.

I now have much better strategies, but it has taken seven years since that day for me to have a fully comprehensive plan to handle the issues my period brings.

By having these conversations with young athletes, making sure they get to know their cycle and that they feel comfortable speaking to coaches and sports doctors, hopefully, incidents like that will occur less frequently in elite sport.

Let's normalize the conversation and end the shame

Another disappointing statistic is that period pain and shame are key reasons why 64% of schoolgirls will drop out of sport.

When I was a teenager, I wouldn't have dared to speak to my male coaches about my period. That was a shame thing, and it was to my detriment. It meant I didn't get the help I needed for so much longer.

It was preventable. We should be able to have those conversations. If more than half of young girls are dropping out because of period issues, then clearly, we have a problem.

We're still not comfortable enough in speaking about it. It needs to become as normal as discussing an injury.

Sport is such a force for good, and if something is proving such a barrier to young women staying in sport, we need to consider it a serious issue.

In families, in coaching situations, let's normalize talking about periods and how your menstrual cycle affects you and your training.

For women my age, we can be making more of an effort to learn about our own cycles. There's only so much we can talk about it if we don't understand ourselves.

A little more education can go a long way. Even at a recreational level, we could prevent someone who is trying to improve their 5k each week from becoming disheartened simply because they can't appreciate that their body isn't capable of a certain time that week.

The fact that periods have an effect on training and on our lives is something we must talk about as though it's normal.",sports

On Saturday, the pair will represent their country on the biggest stage as they fight for titles during International Fight Week at UFC 290 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Interim featherweight champion Rodriguez, 30, faces title holder Alexander Volkanovski in the main event for the undisputed belt. Moreno, 29, defends his flyweight championship against Alexandre Pantoja in the co main.

On the undercard, there are three more Mexican fighters Yazmin Jauregui, Edgar Chairez, and Jesus Aguilar.

 It's a real special card now, I'm happy for everybody. Rodriguez told BBC Sport. Everybody is achieving their dreams to become UFC fighters.

 Now we're showing the world what we're capable of doing. It couldn't make me happier. 

Two years ago, Moreno beat Deiveson Figueiredo to become the first Mexican born champion in UFC history. In February, Rodriguez defeated Josh Emmett for the interim featherweight belt.

Less than a month later, Alexa Grasso stunned fellow flyweight Valentina Shevchenko to become the first Mexican UFC women's champion.

The excitement around MMA is palpable in the country.

 When I go to my hometown, Tijuana, I remember when it was normal to go for a walk or a coffee, and now it's different, said Moreno.

 You can feel the support. Going to the capital of Mexico, you can feel the support. Before, a lot didn't know about MMA, and now they do. 

The UFC is capitalizing on the success of its Mexican stars.

The promotion is building a performance institute in the country to help develop fighters and recently announced a special event in recognition of Mexican Independence Day on 16 September when Grasso will defend her flyweight title in a rematch against Shevchenko.

UFC president Dana White said this week that each Mexican champion will receive a customized belt in the country's colors.

And Rodriguez says youngsters are now taking up MMA over other sports.

 People are bringing their little kids to gyms, said Rodriguez. Before you'd see boxing or karate or taekwondo but nothing like MMA. Now we've got little kids learning about the sport. I think we have a big future.

 Mexican fans are crazy about fighting. It doesn't matter what combat sport it is, they're crazy about it. 

Moreno echoes those thoughts.

 I always say the same I started this sport for myself. I just wanted to prove to myself I could go into the octagon and fight somebody, he said.

 But with all the success, you start to inspire people. I'm very happy when someone tells me this little kid is training because of me or they tag me in social posts. I motivate them, and that made me very proud. ",sports
37,"Russell and teammate Lewis Hamilton were 12th and 15th fastest as they lagged more than a second behind Max Verstappen's pace setting Red Bull.

This was despite Mercedes introducing a new front wing, the latest in a series of recent car upgrades aimed at moving them closer to the front of the field.

Russell said the team had to try to understand their lack of pace.

Hamilton said: It's a tough car to drive and no matter what we do to set it up, it remains a tough car to drive. 

The seven time champion said he felt no improvement when changing from the medium to the theoretically faster soft tire.

 That shows that something's wrong, Hamilton said. We're missing something. And on the long run, it didn't seem too bad, so that's a positive at least.

 George is over here with the setup and I'm over here. He was saying I was thinking of coming over to where you are, but your lap time is slow. And I was like I was thinking of coming to where you are.

 We will work on it tonight and hopefully, we will come up with something for tomorrow. 

Hamilton's race simulation pace was more competitive. He was faster than the Ferrari of Carlos Sainz which was the second fastest on a single lap, just 0.022secs slower than Verstappen but still considerably slower than the world champion's Red Bull.

Russell said: Definitely not our finest Friday. Conditions will be different tomorrow. We need to try to get to the bottom of it.

 The pace in first practice was looking quite good on the medium tire. We thought we were right up there if we took the soft.

 But in P2, we were nowhere and we just need to try and understand that.

 We see a small trend that when the temperature is hotter, we seem to take a bit of a step backwards. We have some ideas why that is. 

Temperatures at Silverstone on Friday, when 120,000 spectators attended the track, were in the high 20Cs but are expected to drop a little for the weekend when rain also threatens.

Verstappen looked imperious, despite his small margin over Sainz, and his long run on a race fuel load was especially impressive.

The Dutchman's race simulation run was more than 0.5secs a lap on average quicker on the same soft tire than teammate Sergio Perez, with Sainz a little further behind.

Williams driver Alex Albon was an impressive third fastest, with teammate Logan Sargeant fifth behind Perez.

Lando Norris was 14th fastest in the upgraded McLaren that impressed so much last weekend in Austria.

Ferrari's Charles Leclerc did not get out in the session at all after the team discovered an electrical problem over the lunch break.

Fernando Alonso, third in the championship for Aston Martin, was only 10th fastest on single lap pace, with teammate Lance Stroll sixth, ahead of the Haas of Nico Hulkenberg, Pierre Gasly's Alpine, and McLaren's Oscar Piastri.

Piastri, an Australian who is in his debut season, has on his car for the first time the upgrade that Norris debuted in Austria, while Norris has those parts in addition to a new front wing.

A number of the drivers said that they were struggling for grip, especially in the first session, as they tried a new, more robust Pirelli tire construction for the first time.

Pirelli has introduced the tire to lessen the risk of failures at high speed tracks such as Silverstone. But despite what the company says is a stronger construction, the teams were told to run the tires at unusually high pressures 26.5 psi at the front and 23 psi at the rear.

This compares with 23 and 20 psi at the Austrian Grand Prix last weekend and 24 and 20 psi at the Spanish Grand Prix last month.",sports

Breaking a British 100m record which had stood for 30 years does not simply happen by chance.

The dreams are plotted, then achieved through dedication. That is how Hughes was able to predict his 9.83 second run in New York last month, to the hundredth detail, eclipsing Linford Christie's performance at the 1993 World Championships.

There is another target on the vision board, but it is likely it will not be widely shared until it has been realised.

 I can't say the time but it's going to happen, Hughes teases. I'm hoping it will be at the World Championships, when it really matters.

 The board has pictures of me accomplishing goals from last season and further back. The times are there too but, for the times to come, the execution must come first, the 27 year old tells BBC Sport.

Not limited to track and field goals alone, other life goals are mapped out before him.

You don't become a qualified pilot by accident, either.

Hughes fulfilled a childhood ambition in 2018 when he successfully completed flight school, a moment set in motion when he was allowed to sit in the cockpit of a small plane on a journey from Anguilla, his country of birth, to the British Virgin Islands.

Captivated, he has come a long way since that unfazed 10 year old was warned not to touch anything that day in the cockpit despite his wishes.

 The scenery you get, the whole vibe of hearing other pilots on the frequencies, listening to the engines. It's just amazing knowing you're in control.

 It's an amazing accomplishment and it's something I've always had a passion for. 

A move to Jamaica, where he undertook his pilot training, proved life changing in every way.

There, he continued his athletics development in the presence of the nation's sprinting legends Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake, and under the guidance of Glen Mills the coach who helped Bolt achieve his eight Olympic titles.

 I remember being star struck, Hughes says.

 Seeing Usain Bolt for the first time, this was a guy I had seen on TV, someone I was always YouTubing, watching his videos to learn how to run fast like him.",sports
43,"England forward Lauren James says she is keen to make a name for herself at this summer's World Cup, rather than be known as Reece James' sister .

The 21 year old Chelsea star plays for the same club as her older brother, who is also an England international, and often hears her name linked with his.

 Even just 'that's Lauren James, that's Reece's sister', she said.

 But I want to carve out [my own name] and be known as 'this is Lauren James'. 

James added At the moment, men's football has a lot bigger profile and I'm sure there are times when I've said 'oh, that's so and so's sister', I think it's just natural.

 But it doesn't bother me too much because I know I have my own career. 

Having not been involved in the Lionesses' Euro 2022 triumph, the World Cup, which starts on 20 July, will give James the chance to become the first member of her family to win a major international tournament although she says there is not much sibling rivalry with her brother.

 To be fair, I think he'd just be proud. We're just like best friends, she said.

 His advice was just to enjoy it the World Cup, have fun, try and score goals. ",sports
44,"Engine overrun a sound created when droplets of fuel escape on to red hot exhaust pipes. Sometimes it sounds like thunder. Sometimes a robot exploding. Sometimes like a huge tree snapping in half. Occasionally, if you're close enough, it rattles your rib cage. Curiously, it doesn't register on television coverage, but it is loud. Very loud. It is part of motorsport's majesty. Whether it is part of its future, though, is another thing. The sound of fuel frying on metal seems to many to be increasingly out of step with a warming world, in which climate consciousness is rising with the mercury. At Le Mans, engine overrun drowns out a backing track of thumping house music, fireworks and drunken roars. About 300,000 people flock to north west France for this annual Glastonbury for petrolheads, with the hardest core collecting around the Dunlop Curve to watch the action. The headline act, as ever, is the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Over the course of a day and night, three strong driver teams battle fatigue and the field to steer their aggressive prototype racing machine towards one of the biggest prizes in motorsport. This year marks 100 years since the race's first staging. For a while, though, it seemed likely to limp past the landmark. With the prohibitive costs of competition and the race's old school image apparently out of time, Toyota had been the only top level manufacturer competing in recent years, effectively racing themselves. The glory days, epitomised by the 1971 film Le Mans in which actor Steve McQueen broods and Porsches and Ferraris battle under banners advertising oil and cigarettes seemed gone for good. The organisers faced a dilemma: how to tap a rich past while making the race relevant once again. The answer lay in the rule book. These new regulations permit car manufacturers to have freedom of design and now we have fantastic cars, says World Endurance Championship CEO Frederic Lequien. It's a return to the history of Ferrari competing against Peugeot, Porsche and Cadillac. We have the best car manufacturers in the world. Never in history has endurance racing been so bright. Looser restrictions have given rise to hypercars beautiful evolutions of sportscars of the past, with each company free to follow a philosophy and field statement making models, something that is far harder to do in Formula 1 and Formula E, where largely identikit cars fill the grid. Lining up for this year's season are a sleek Porsche, General Motors' Cadillac, which sounds like a muscle car on steroids, and Peugeot's masterpiece, the 9 8 a rear wing less, childhood dream of a design. But this revival which saw the race sold out two weeks after going on sale is led by Ferrari, who have returned to Le Mans after 50 years away, adding to their already exhaustive F1 schedule. We are very, very busy, but very happy, says Antonello Coletta, Ferrari's head of GT sport. We come back to the pinnacle of endurance in the most important category hypercar with less time in respect to the other competitors, but we are super happy. Le Mans is the most important race in the world. Coletta is part of a new mould of Ferrari leaders. Gone are the Gucci socks and blazers. He reflects a more business like approach, and you can hear it in his words. He says that many parts of the 499P which, like all good Ferraris, is beautiful, but hard to manage are being tested for use on road cars. The most important component isn't part of the 499P's sweeping bodywork, however. It is hidden away, deep in the engine. And it is the innovation, maybe more than any other, that is critical for Le Mans' future.",sports

49,"WorldCom trial starts in New York

The trial of Bernie Ebbers, former chief executive of bankrupt US phone company WorldCom, has started in New York with the selection of the jury.

Mr Ebbers, 63, is accused of being the mastermind behind an $11bn (£6bn) accounting fraud that eventually saw the firm collapse in July 2002. His indictment includes charges of securities fraud, conspiracy and filing false reports with regulators. If found guilty, Mr Ebbers could face a substantial jail sentence. He has firmly declared his innocence.

Under Mr Ebbers' leadership, WorldCom emerged from Mississippi obscurity to become a $160bn telecoms giant and the darling of late 1990s investors. Yet as competition intensified and the telecoms boom petered out, WorldCom found itself under growing financial stress. When WorldCom finally collapsed, shareholders lost about $180bn and 20,000 workers lost their jobs. Mr Ebbers' trial, which is expected to last two months, is the latest in a series of attempts by US prosecutors to pursue senior executives for fraud. It will coincide with the retrial of former Tyco International chief Dennis Kozlowski and his top lieutenant, accused of looting the industrial conglomerate to the tune of $600m. Trail preparations are also preparing for former executives of shamed US energy firm Enron.

50,"Tsunami slows Sri Lanka's growth

Sri Lanka's president has launched a reconstruction drive worth $3.5bn (£1.8bn) by appealing for peace and national unity.

President Kumaratunga said it was now important to find a peaceful solution to years of internal conflict. Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said damage from the tsunami would cut one percentage point from Sri Lanka's economic growth this year. It estimated the wave left physical damage equal to 6.5% of the economy.

Separately, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) said that at least one million people have lost their livelihoods in Sri Lanka and Indonesia alone. It called for action to create jobs. President Kumaratunga attended a ceremony in the southern town of Hambantota. She was joined by government and opposition politicians, together with Buddhist, Hindu, Muslim and Christian clergy.

Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapakse laid the foundation stone on a new housing project intended to provide 6,000 homes for survivors of the tsunami. Mrs Kumaratunga called for the tragedy to be ""the start of a new beginning to rebuild our nation"". ""We are a country blessed with so many natural resources and we have not made use of them fully. Instead we have been squabbling, fighting,"" she added. Norway's peace negotiator Erik Solheim is due to arrive on Wednesday to try to revive peace talks in the decades-long conflict between government forces and the Tamil Tigers, who want a separate state in the north east of the country. Reconstruction efforts in eastern Sri Lanka have been hampered by tensions between the two sides.

The IMF said that the Sri Lankan authorities' initial estimates have put the physical damage at $1.3 to $1.5bn, but added that the implications for the economy were much wider than this. ""The broader macroeconomic impact will clearly be substantial but the details are difficult to assess at this early stage,"" the IMF said. Growth, inflation, the balance of payments and foreign exchange reserves are all expected to show the effects of lost businesses and reconstruction costs. ""The fishing industry has been devastated, agricultural production may be affected and tourism will suffer, especially in the short term,"" the report said. The ILO estimated that 400,000 Sri Lankans have lost their jobs, mostly in these three industries. Earnings from tourism this year are expected to be 15% lower than last year. Economic growth this year is expected to be 4%, which is about 1% less than previously forecast. Inflation could climb to 14% compared to a previous estimate of 12%. Although major exports have not suffered, the IMF expects the reconstruction effort will require higher imports which could damage the balance of payments. Foreign exchange reserves may become strained as ""Sri Lanka will be hard pressed to keep international reserves at the pre-tsunami level"" which totalled more than two months worth of imports. Last week, the IMF approved Sri Lanka's request for a freeze on loan repayments.

51,"Christmas shoppers flock to tills

Shops all over the UK reported strong sales on the last Saturday before Christmas with some claiming record-breaking numbers of festive shoppers.

A spokesman for Manchester's Trafford Centre said it was ""the biggest Christmas to date"" with sales up 5%. And the Regent Street Association said shops in central London were also expecting the ""best Christmas ever"". That picture comes despite reports of disappointing festive sales in the last couple of weeks.

The Trafford Centre spokeswoman said about 8,500 thousand vehicles had arrived at the centre on Saturday before 1130 GMT. ""We predict that the next week will continue the same trend,"" she added.

It was a similar story at Bluewater in Kent. Spokesman Alan Jones said he expected 150,000 shoppers to have visited by the end of Saturday and a further 100,000 on Sunday. ""Our sales so far have been 2% up on the same time last year,"" he said. ""We're very busy, it's really strong and people will be shopping right up until Christmas. ""Over the Christmas period we're expecting people to spend in excess of £200m at the centre.""

On Saturday afternoon, a spokeswoman for the St David's Shopping Centre in Cardiff said it looked like being its busiest day of the year with about 200,000 shoppers expected to have visited by the close of play. At the St Enoch's Shopping Centre in Glasgow, more than 140,000 shoppers - an all-time record - were expected to have passed through the doors by its closing time of 1900 GMT. Senior business manager Jon Walton said: ""It has been phenomenal - absolutely mobbed. ""Every week footfall has been showing strong growth and at the weekends it has been going mad."" Regent Street Association director Annie Walker said on Saturday: ""The stores were heaving today and a lot of people are going to be doing last minute shopping as many people finished work on Friday and can go in the week.""

She said reports of a slump in pre-Christmas sales were related to the growing popularity of internet sales. ""I do think this has had a lot to do with reports of lower sales figures,"" she said. ""Internet shopping has gone up enormously and not all stores have websites.""

Iraq is to invite bids for two telephone licences, saying it wants to significantly boost nationwide coverage over the next decade.

Bids have been invited from local, Arab and foreign companies, Iraq's Ministry of Communications said. The winner will work in partnership with the Iraqi Telecommunications and Post Company (ITPC). The firms will install and operate a fixed phone network, providing voice, fax and internet services.

The ministry said that it wanted to increase Iraq's ""very low telephone service penetration rate from about 4.5% today to about 25% within 10 years."" It also hopes to develop a ""highly visible and changeable telecommunication sector"". Details of the bidding and tender process will be published on the ministry's website on 9 February. It also is planning a road-show for investors in Amman, Jordan. The ministry said it would base its selection on criteria including the speed of implementation, tariff rates, coverage, and the firm's experience and financial strength.

53,"Australia rates at four year high

Australia is raising its benchmark interest rate to its highest level in four years despite signs of a slowdown in the country's economy.

The Reserve Bank of Australia lifted interest rates 0.25% to 5.5%, their first upwards move in more than a year. However, shortly after the Bank made its decision, new figures showed a fall in economic growth in the last quarter. The Bank said it had acted to curb inflation but the move was criticised by some analysts.

The rate hike was the first since December 2003 and had been well-flagged in advance. However, opposition parties and some analysts said the move was ill-timed given data showing the Australian economy grew just 0.1% between October and December and 1.5% on an annual basis.

The figures, representing a decline from the 0.2% growth in GDP seen between July and September, were below market expectations. Consumer spending remains strong, however, and the Bank is concerned about growing inflationary pressures. ""Over recent months it has become increasingly clear that remaining spare capacity in the labour and goods markets is becoming rather limited,"" said Ian Macfarlane, Governor of the Reserve Bank.

At 2.6%, inflation remains within the Bank's 2-3% target range. However, exports declined in the second half of 2004, fuelling a rise in the country's current account deficit - the difference in the value of imports compared to exports - to a record Australian dollar 29.4bn. The Australian government said the economy remained strong with unemployment at a near 30 year low. ""The economy has been strong and it is properly moderating but it doesn't look to me like it's slowing in any unreasonable way,"" said Treasurer Peter Costello. Stock markets had factored in the likelihood of a rate rise but analysts still expressed concern about the strength of the economy. ""That 1.5% annual growth rate is the lowest we have seen since the post-election slump we saw back in 2000-1,"" said Michael Blythe, chief economist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. ""This suggests the economy really did slow very sharply in the second half of 2004.""

54,"Glaxo aims high after profit fall

GlaxoSmithKline saw its profits fall 9% last year to £6.2bn ($11.5bn), but Europe's biggest drugmaker says a recovery during 2005 is on the way.

Cheap copies of its drugs, particularly anti-depressants Paxil and Wellbutrin, and a weak dollar had hit profits, but global sales were up 1% in 2004. The firm is confident its new drug pipeline will deliver profits despite the failure of an obesity drug. Chief executive Jean-Pierre Garnier said it had been a ""difficult year"".

In early afternoon trade in London the company share price was down 1% at 1218 pence. Mr Garnier said the company had absorbed over £1.5bn of lost sales to generics but still managing to grow the business. ""The continuing success of our key products means we can now look forward to a good performance in 2005,"" he said. ""2005 will also be an important year in terms of research and development pipeline progress."" However, the firm discontinued development of an experimental treatment for obesity, known as '771, after disappointing clinical trial results. Glaxo is relying on new treatments for conditions such as cancer, diabetes, depression, HIV/AIDS and allergies to lift the pace of sales growth after several disappointing years.

55,"BMW cash to fuel Mini production

Less than four years after the new Mini was launched, German car maker BMW has announced £100m of new investment.

Some 200 new jobs are to be created at the Oxford factory, including modernised machinery and a new body shell production building. The result of the investment could be to raise output to more than 200,000 cars from 2007. The rise, from 189,000 last year, is a response to rapidly-rising demand and could help wipe out waiting lists. Before Wednesday's announcement, BMW had invested some £280m in Mini production.

Since its launch during summer 2001, the new Mini has gone from strength to strength.

Last year, almost one in six cars sold by the BMW group was a Mini. The company admits that the success of the brand came despite scepticism from many in the industry. ""Our decision to produce a new Mini was not received well right away,"" said Norbert Reithofer, a member of the BMW management board. Initially, BMW said it would produce 100,000 Mini models a year at its vast Cowley factory on the outskirts of Oxford, but the target was quickly reached, then raised, time and time again. Not everyone is convinced that the boom can continue. ""The risk is that after they've invested massively in the brand, demand tapers off like it did with the new VW Beetle,"" said Brad Wernle, from Automotive News Europe.

The price of the car has also gone up. When it was launched, the cheapest Mini cost just more than £10,000. These days, buyers will have to fork out almost £11,500 to own a new Mini One, or even more for the Cooper S which costs up to £17,730. The Mini Convertible, which was launched last spring, costs up to £15,690 for the top model, and there is even a waiting list. Second-hand Minis are not cheap either. A Mini One bought when the model was launched should still fetch at least £8,000 for the cheapest model, while a used Cooper S is likely to be priced from £12,556, according to the-car buying website Parker's. The consumers' association Which operates with slightly different numbers, yet it confirms that the Mini Cooper 1.6 depreciates slower than any other car, other than the Mercedes Benz C180 SE and the BMW 1 Series 116i SE.

The Cowley factory, which initially seemed far too large a production plant for just 100,000 Minis, is increasingly being put to good use.

There are plans to tear down old buildings and build new ones and there are rumours that a new paint shop could be included in the plans. BMW's Mini adventure has made good much of what went wrong during its stewardship of the UK car maker Rover which it sold for £10 five years ago to the Phoenix consortium. In 1999, when BMW still owned Rover, the Oxford factory was producing the award-winning Rover 75. During that year, 3,500 people produced 56,000 cars. Last year, in the same factory, almost four times as many vehicles were produced by just 4,500 Mini-workers. The Mini factory's current output is equally impressive when compared with the main Rover factory in Longbridge, which in 1999 produced 180,000 Rover cars. Last year, MG Rover, which employs more than 6,000 people, produced just 110,000 cars, though it hopes to land a deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) that could help double the number of cars produced at Longbridge. Indeed, Mini is not only producing more cars than MG Rover does; it remains ahead even when the current sales of Land Rovers and Range Rovers (which are made by the former Rover unit that BMW sold to Ford) are taken into account.

56,"EU ministers to mull jet fuel tax

European Union finance ministers are meeting on Thursday in Brussels, where they are to discuss a controversial jet fuel tax.

A levy on jet fuel has been suggested as a way to raise funds to finance aid for the world's poorest nations. Airlines and aviation bodies have reacted strongly against the plans, saying they would hurt companies at a time when earnings are under pressure. The EU said a tax would only be passed after full consultation with airlines. It was keen to point out earlier this week that any new tax on jet fuel should not hurt the ""competitiveness of the airlines"". Ministers will also be discussing reforms to regulations governing European public spending.

Global leaders have focused attention on poverty reduction and development at recent meetings of the G7 Group and World Economic Forum. The world's richest countries have said they want to boost the amount of aid they give to 0.7% of their annual gross national income by 2015. Many EU ministers are thought to support the plan to tax jet fuel - tabled by France and Germany following the recent G7 meeting. At present, the fuel used by airlines enjoys either a very low tax rate or is untaxed in EU member states.

57,"Further rise in UK jobless total

The UK's jobless total rose for the second month in a row in December, official figures show.

The number of people out of work rose 32,000 to 1.41 million in the last three months of 2004, even as 90,000 more people were in employment. Average earnings rose by 4.3% in the year to December up from November's 4.2%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) added. Meanwhile, the benefit claimant total fell 11,000 to 813,200 last month. Throughout 2004, the number of people in work increased by 296,000 to 28.52 million - the highest figure since records began in 1971.

The apparent discrepancy between rising unemployment and record numbers in work can be explained by an increase in the working population and a fall in those who are economically inactive. While the UK's jobless rate rose to 4.7% from 4.6% in the previous quarter, the rate still remains one of the lowest in the world, compared with 12.1% in Germany, 10.4% in Spain and 9.7% in France. But, despite more people being in work, the manufacturing sector continued to suffer, with 104,000 workers axed during the last quarter of 2004 - pushing employment in the sector to a record low of 3.24 million by the end of last year. The figures prompted some analysts to forecast that the Bank of England will almost certainly raise rates this year. Marc Ostwald, a strategist at Monument Securities told Reuters that while no immediate market impact could be expected, ""it is enough to underline that they (the BoE) will be more hawkish on rates"".

58,"Turkey turns on the economic charm

Three years after a gruelling economic crisis, Turkey has dressed its economy to impress.

As part of a charm offensive - ahead of 17 December, when the European Union will decide whether to start entry talks - Turkey's economic leaders have been banging the drum to draw attention to recent achievements. The economy is growing fast, they insist. Education levels among its young and large population are rising. Unemployment levels, in percentage terms, are heading fast towards single digits. Inflation is under control. A new law to govern its turbulent banking system is on the cards. The tourism industry is booming and revenues from visitors should more than double to $21bn (£10.8bn) in three years.

Moreover, government spending is set to be frozen and a burdensome social security deficit is being tackled. Income and corporate taxes will be cut next year in order to attract $15bn of foreign investment over the next three years. A loan restructuring deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is pretty much in the can. And following recent macroeconomic restructuring efforts, its currency is floating freely and its central bank is independent.

The point of all this has been to convince Europe's decision makers that rather than being a phenomenally costly exercise for the EU, allowing Turkey in would in fact bring masses of economic benefits.

""The cake will be bigger for everybody,"" said Deputy Prime Minister Abdullatif Sener earlier this month. ""Turkey will not be a burden for the EU budget."" If admitted into the EU, Turkey would contribute almost 6bn euros ($8bn; £6bn) to its budget by 2014, according to a recent impact study by the country's State Planning Organisation. As Turkey's gross domestic output (GDP) is set to grow by 6% per year on average, its contribution would rise from less than 5bn euros in 2014 to almost 9bn euros by 2020. Turkey could also help alleviate a labour shortage in ""Old Europe"" once its population comes of age. By 2014, one in four Turks - or about 18 million people - will be aged 14 or less. ""A literate and qualified Turkish population,"" insisted Mr Sener, ""will make a positive impact on the EU.""

This runs contrary to the popular view that Turkey is getting ready to dig deep into EU taxpayers' wallets. However, Turkey's assertions are confirmed by Brussels' own impact studies, which indeed say that Turkish membership would be good news for the EU economy. But only over time. Costs are projected to be vast during the early years of Turkey's membership, with subsidies alone estimated to exceed 16.5bn euros and, according to some predictions, balloon to 33.5bn euros. This would include vast agricultural subsidies and regional aid, though such payments should decline as the country's farm sector, which currently employs one in three Turks, would employ just one in five by 2020.

Such high initial expenses would be coupled with risks that the benefits flagged up by Turkey's government would never be delivered, say those who feel the Turkish project should be shunned.

Some fear that rather than providing an educated, sophisticated labour force for Europe at large, the people who will leave Turkey to seek work abroad will be poor, uneducated - and plentiful. More recently, less palatable concerns - at least in liberal European circles - have been voiced, with senior EU or member state officials talking darkly of a ""river of Islam"", an ""oriental"" culture and a threat to Europe's ""cultural richness"". Of course, many opponents are politically motivated - their views ranging from xenophobic prejudices about the country's Muslim traditions to well-documented concerns about the government's human rights record. Yet their economic arguments should not be dismissed out of hand.

Critics insist that much of the optimism about Turkey's economic roadmap has been over-egged - an argument amplified by a 134% rise in the country's current account deficit to $10.7bn during the first 10 months of this year.

The country's massive debt - which includes $23bn owed to the IMF and billions borrowed via the international bond markets - also remains a major obstacle to its ambition of joining the EU. ""In the new member states of the European Union, gross public debt is typically about 40% of gross domestic product,"" says Reza Moghadam, assistant director of the IMF's European Department. ""At about 80% of GDP, Turkey's gross debt is double that figure."" Turkey's debts have largely arisen from its efforts to push through banking reform after a run on the banks in 2001 caused the country's devastating recession. ""There is no question that although Turkey is doing much better than in the past, it remains quite vulnerable,"" says Michael Deppler, director of the IMF's European Department. ""Its debt is far too high for an emerging economy."" A key factor for EU decision makers should be whether or not Turkey has met its economic criteria. But economics is not a science. And although the state of Turkey's economy is important, as is its pace of reform, the final decision on 17 December will be taken by politicians who will, of course, be guided by their political instincts.

59,"China now top trader with Japan

China overtook the US to become Japan's biggest trading partner in 2004, according to numbers released by Japan's Finance Ministry on Wednesday.

China accounted for 20.1% of Japan's trade in 2004, compared with 18.6% for the US. In 2003, the US was ahead with 20.5% and China came second with 19.2%. The change highlights China's growing importance as an economic powerhouse. In 2004, Japan's imports from and exports to China (and Hong Kong) added up to 22,201bn yen ($214.6bn;£114.5bn). This is the highest figure for Japanese trade with China since records began in 1947. It compares with 20,479.5bn yen in trade with the US.

Trade with the US during 2004 was hurt by one-off factors, including a 13-month ban on US beef imports following the discovery of a cow infected with mad cow disease (BSE) in the US. However, economists predict China will become an even more important Japanese trading partner in the coming years. On Tuesday, figures showed China's economy grew by 9.5% in 2004 and experts say the overall growth picture remains strong. Analysts see two spurs to future growth as being China's membership of the World Trade Organisation and lower trade tariffs. During 2004, Japan's trade surplus grew 17.9% to 12.011 trillion yen, with more than half the surplus, 6.962 trillion yen, accounted for by its trade with the US. In December, the surplus grew 1.8% on a year ago to 1.14 trillion yen thanks to stronger-than-expected exports.

60,"Split-caps pay £194m compensation

Investors who lost money following the split-capital investment trust scandal are to receive £194m compensation, the UK's financial watchdog has announced.

Eighteen investment firms involved in the sale of the investments agreed the compensation package with the Financial Services Authority (FSA). Splits were marketed as a low-risk way to benefit from rising share prices. But when the stock market collapsed in 2000, the products left thousands of investors out of pocket. An estimated 50,000 people took out split-capital funds, some investing their life savings in the schemes. The paying of compensation will be overseen by an independent company, the FSA said.

Further details of how investors will be able to claim their share of the compensation package will be announced in the new year. ""This should save investors from having to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service, something, no doubt, that will be very welcome,"" Rob McIvor, FSA spokesman, told BBC News. Agreeing to pay compensation did not mean that the eighteen firms involved were admitting any guilt, the FSA added. Any investor accepting the compensation will have to waive the right to take their case to the Financial Ombudsman Service.

The FSA has been investigating whether investors were misled about the risks posed by split-capital investment trusts. The FSA's 60 strong investigation team looked into whether fund managers colluded in a so-called ""magic circle"", in the hope of propping up one another's share prices.

Firms involved were presented with 780 files of evidence detailing 27,000 taped conversations and over 70 interviews. In May, the FSA was widely reported as having asked firms to pay up to £350m in compensation. Mr McIvor told the BBC that the final settlement figure was smaller because two unnamed firms had pulled out of the compensation negotiations. Investors in these two firms may now have to take any compensation claim to the Financial Ombudsman Service or the courts.

61,"GE sees 'excellent' world economy

US behemoth General Electric has posted an 18% jump in quarterly sales, and in profits, and declared itself ""in great shape"".

""We are benefiting from our growth initiatives and an excellent global economy,"" said GE's chief executive Jeff Immelt. GE is the US' biggest firm based on stock market valuation. GE's net profits were $5.37bn (£2.86bn) for the final three months of 2004, while sales came in at $43.7bn. The group, whose businesses range from jet engines to the NBC television channel, forecast sustained growth at between 10-15% for this year and next. GE's shares rose 1% on the news before ending Friday 0.24% lower.

""The industries GE is in are doing very well. The materials, financial and industrial sectors are all picking up,"" said Steve Roukis, an analyst at fund manager Matrix Asset Advisors, which has shares in GE. GE said orders in the fourth quarter were 15% higher than in the same period of 2003, ""with growth across the board"". ""In the fourth quarter, nine of our 11 businesses delivered at least double-digit earnings growth,"" said Mr Immelt. Full year 2004 gains were less spectacular, but still respectable. Net profit was up 6% at $16.6bn. Last year, GE bought Vivendi Universal, merging it with NBC to form NBC Universal. The success of Universal Studio's film 'Ray', a portrait of jazz musician Ray Charles, has helped boost earnings at the unit.

62,"Five million Germans out of work

Germany's unemployment figure rose above the psychologically important level of five million last month.

On Wednesday, the German Federal Labour Agency said the jobless total had reached 5.037 million in January, which takes the jobless rate to 12.1%. ""Yes, we have effectively more than five million people unemployed,"" a government minister said earlier on ZDF public television. Unemployment has not been this high in Germany since the 1930s.

Changes to the way the statistics are compiled partly explain the jump of 572,900 in the numbers. But the figures are embarrassing for the government. ""With the figures apparently the worst we've seen in the post-war period, these numbers are very charged politically,"" said Christian Jasperneite, an economist with MM Warburg. ""They could well put an end to the recent renaissance we've seen by the SPD [the ruling Social Democrats] in the polls, and with state elections due in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, they may have an adverse effect on the government's chances there.""

The opposition also made political capital from the figures. It said there are a further 1.5 million-2 million people on subsidised employment schemes who are, in fact, looking for real jobs. It added that government reforms, including unpopular benefit cuts, do not go far enough. Under the government's controversial ""Hartz IV"" reforms, which came into effect at the beginning of the year, both those on unemployment benefits and welfare support and those who are long-term unemployed are officially classified as looking for work. The bad winter weather also took its toll, as key sectors such as the construction sector laid off workers. Adjusted for the seasonal factors, the German jobless total rose by 227,000 in January from December.

63,"Booming markets shed few tears

The market, former British government minister Michael Heseltine once said, has no morality.

And indeed, stock exchange traders around Asia have wasted little time regretting the victims of this week's disaster. Stock markets in Indonesia and India have hit all-time highs this week; even in Sri Lanka, more comprehensively affected, the main index has lost only 5% since the waves hit. Bigger markets further afield have barely twitched. The MSCI World share index, a measure of global stock market performance, hit its highest level this week since early 2001; the BBC Global 30 has risen by 3% in the past week. And this at a time when - all sentiment aside - insurance costs are already estimated in the tens of billions of dollars, and countries around the region are looking at trimming their growth forecasts.

In fact, the markets are being perfectly rational.

For a start, the notional insurance cost of the disaster will have little bearing on corporate bottom lines. The overwhelming majority of the victims will have had no insurance: according to estimates from India, only one-quarter of those affected there were wealthy enough to afford insurance, and only one-quarter of that group at most will have taken out policies. Indonesia is likely to have even lower take-up rates. And where insurance certainly is in place - in, for example, the many tourist complexes affected - the costs will be borne in far-away corners of the global reinsurance market, rather than landing locally.

Second, stock markets do not trade the sort of companies likely to have been damaged. Most of the biggest companies traded on the soaring Jakarta Stock Exchange are in oil, technology and financial services - none of which have been hit by the flooding. Tourist businesses, the most likely sufferers, are either foreign-owned or too small to have their shares listed. Those that are listed have suffered: Confifi Hotel Holdings, a small Sri Lankan tourism firm, has halved in value this week. But there are winners as well as losers. Asian stock markets are heavily inclined towards property and construction companies, many of which will be rubbing their hands over the reconstruction opportunities. In Indonesia, shares in state construction companies Adhi Karya and Semen Gresik have jumped sharply this week.

More broadly, the academic consensus is that major disasters are largely neutral in their longer-term economic impact.

According to the Natural Hazards Research and Applications Information Center at Colorado State University, there is little evidence that disasters are inevitably followed by a depression. The need to find money to replace lost and damaged property is balanced by the beneficial effect of reconstruction activity; there is rarely, the centre says, any sort of rebuilding boom, but in most cases sizeable indirect losses are avoided. A study of the 1993 Des Moines floods, from the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware*, found that 70% of local businesses were no worse off after the disaster, and another 18% felt themselves better off. ""Although it is commonly assumed on the basis of anecdotal evidence that disasters result in business failures and bankruptcies on a large scale, our research indicates that most businesses, even those that are especially hard-hit, do indeed recover,"" the authors concluded.

But disasters have a vast psychological impact, and markets are driven by psychological factors.

In particular, many analysts warn of panic spreading unchecked through the global financial system, as investors seek to cover themselves against the unforeseeable effects of unguessable events. In fact, again, the risks here are lower than they seem. Even the costliest natural disaster is rendered minuscule by the global capital market - currently $30 trillion and rising. A series of recent shocks, the Colorado centre has argued, have demonstrated that this seamless global contagion hardly ever happens: market tremors rarely translate into economic slumps, and economic woes rarely seriously undermine markets. The trillion-dollar debts of Japan's banks, for example, have had no effect on stock markets further afield than Tokyo. And the US stock market was on its way down long before 11 September, 2001; it rose by 20% during the six months following the attacks. ""It is not that the broking community is indifferent to disasters or feelings,"" one Bombay trader said this week. ""But the reaction would have been seen if business had been affected. Business sense probably tends to overrule everything else.""

64,"UK economy ends year with spurt

The UK economy grew by an estimated 3.1% in 2004 after accelerating in the last quarter of the year, says the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The figure is in line with Treasury and Bank of England forecasts. The ONS says gross domestic product (GDP) rose by a strong 0.7% in the three months to 31 December, compared with 0.5% in the previous quarter. The rise came despite a further decline in production output and the worst Christmas for retailers in decades.

The annual figure marked out the best year since 2000, and was also well ahead of the 2.2% recorded in 2003. Growth in the final three months of 2004 marked the 50th consecutive quarter of expansion. ""On the basis of the latest information the UK has entered 2005 on course to continue its record period of growth,"" said Paul Boateng, chief secretary to the Treasury in a statement.

The ONS said the services sector, which accounts for nearly three-quarters of the UK economy, grew 1.0% in the quarter. The strong services figure was welcomed by analysts, given lacklustre retail sales in December and across the Christmas holiday period. ""The fact that other services components are doing so well suggests to me that we are back to trend (growth) and I am not particularly concerned about any further slowdown,"" said Ross Walker, UK economist at RBS Financial Markets.

However, output in the production sector contracted 0.5%, the second quarterly fall in row and a state of affairs that some economists classify as a recession. However the ONS would not comment on the definition of a recession and whether the manufacturing recovery was over. But Steve Radley, chief economist at the manufacturers' organisation EEF, said: ""These figures remain at odds with what is actually happening on the ground. ""Whilst companies may be experiencing tougher conditions this year, 'recession' is not a word that manufacturers would currently recognise."" The ONS said a sharp fall in mining and quarrying, which was driven by oil and gas extraction, was primarily responsible for the overall contraction in manufacturing production figures.

Simon Rubinsohn, chief economist at Gerrard, said: ""This outturn (of 0.7%) was well ahead of the market expectations and cast doubt on the scare stories doing the rounds surrounding the current state of the UK economy."" And he said the GDP figures may help to ""push interest rate expectations a little higher along the curve"". ""The suggestion from the money markets is that the next move is now more likely to be in an upward rather than a downward direction. This is consistent with our own thinking,"" said Mr Rubinsohn. The Bank of England's nine-strong rate-setting committee voted unanimously earlier this month to keep interest rates steady at 4.75%, minutes of the meeting showed on Wednesday.

66,"Metlife buys up Citigroup insurer

US banking giant Citigroup has sold its Travelers Life & Annuity insurance arm to Metlife for $11.5bn (£6.1bn).

The sale is a further move by Citigroup away from its 1990s strategy of offering every financial service - insurance, broking and banking. Profit growth in the insurance market has not matched expansion at Citigroup's other businesses. For Metlife, the US's leading insurance company, the purchase gives it access to a much larger distribution network.

Robert Benmosche, Metlife's chairman and chief executive, said that it was a ""great opportunity for the brand of Metlife to be distributed through Citigroup"". Under the agreement, Metlife will be able to sell its products through Citigroup over the next 10 years. The deal includes Smith Barney retail brokerages and Citibank branches. The company will pay between $1bn and $3bn in Metlife stock with the rest being made up of cash. Travelers had sales of $5.2bn in 2004 and made a profit of $901m. It has total net assets of $96bn. ""This deal employs some of Metlife's excess capital in a potentially higher-return business and gives it more distribution,"" said Stuart Quint, an analyst at Gartmore.

67,"China had role in Yukos split-up

China lent Russia $6bn (£3.2bn) to help the Russian government renationalise the key Yuganskneftegas unit of oil group Yukos, it has been revealed.

The Kremlin said on Tuesday that the $6bn which Russian state bank VEB lent state-owned Rosneft to help buy Yugansk in turn came from Chinese banks. The revelation came as the Russian government said Rosneft had signed a long-term oil supply deal with China. The deal sees Rosneft receive $6bn in credits from China's CNPC.

According to Russian newspaper Vedomosti, these credits would be used to pay off the loans Rosneft received to finance the purchase of Yugansk. Reports said CNPC had been offered 20% of Yugansk in return for providing finance but the company opted for a long-term oil supply deal instead. Analysts said one factor that might have influenced the Chinese decision was the possibility of litigation from Yukos, Yugansk's former owner, if CNPC had become a shareholder. Rosneft and VEB declined to comment. ""The two companies [Rosneft and CNPC] have agreed on the pre-payment for long-term deliveries,"" said Russian oil official Sergei Oganesyan. ""There is nothing unusual that the pre-payment is for five to six years.""

The announcements help to explain how Rosneft, a medium-sized, indebted, and relatively unknown firm, was able to finance its surprise purchase of Yugansk. Yugansk was sold for $9.3bn in an auction last year to help Yukos pay off part of a $27bn bill in unpaid taxes and fines.

The embattled Russian oil giant had previously filed for bankruptcy protection in a US court in an attempt to prevent the forced sale of its main production arm. But Yugansk was sold to a little known shell company which in turn was bought by Rosneft. Yukos claims its downfall was punishment for the political ambitions of its founder Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Once the country's richest man, Mr Khodorkovsky is on trial for fraud and tax evasion.

The deal between Rosneft and CNPC is seen as part of China's desire to secure long-term oil supplies to feed its booming economy. China's thirst for products such as crude oil, copper and steel has helped pushed global commodity prices to record levels. ""Clearly the Chinese are trying to get some leverage [in Russia],"" said Dmitry Lukashov, an analyst at brokerage Aton. ""They understand property rights in Russia are not the most important rights, and they are more interested in guaranteeing supplies."" ""If the price of oil is fixed under the deal, which is unlikely, it could be very profitable for the Chinese,"" Mr Lukashov continued. ""And Rosneft is in desperate need of cash, so it's a good deal for them too.""

68,"Cars pull down US retail figures

US retail sales fell 0.3% in January, the biggest monthly decline since last August, driven down by a heavy fall in car sales.

The 3.3% fall in car sales had been expected, coming after December's 4% rise in car sales, fuelled by generous pre-Christmas special offers. Excluding the car sector, US retail sales were up 0.6% in January, twice what some analysts had been expecting. US retail spending is expected to rise in 2005, but not as quickly as in 2004.

Steve Gallagher, US chief economist at SG Corporate & Investment Banking, said January's figures were ""decent numbers"".

""We are not seeing the numbers that we saw in the second half of 2004, but they are still pretty healthy,"" he added. Sales at appliance and electronic stores were down 0.6% in January, while sales at hardware stores dropped by 0.3% and furniture store sales dipped 0.1%. Sales at clothing and clothing accessory stores jumped 1.8%, while sales at general merchandise stores, a category that includes department stores, rose by 0.9%. These strong gains were in part put down to consumers spending gift vouchers they had been given for Christmas.

Sales at restaurants, bars and coffee houses rose by 0.3%, while grocery store sales were up 0.5%. In December, overall retail sales rose by 1.1%. Excluding the car sector, sales rose by just 0.3%. Parul Jain, deputy chief economist at Nomura Securities International, said consumer spending would continue to rise in 2005, only at a slower rate of growth than in 2004. ""Consumers continue to retain their strength in the first quarter,"" he said. Van Rourke, a bond strategist at Popular Securities, agreed that the latest retail sales figures were ""slightly stronger than expected"".

69,"US insurer Marsh cuts 2,500 jobs

Up to 2,500 jobs are to go at US insurance broker Marsh & McLennan in a shake up following bigger-than-expected losses.

The insurer said the cuts were part of a cost-cutting drive, aimed at saving millions of dollars. Marsh posted a $676m (£352m) loss for the last three months of 2004, against a $375m (£195.3m) profit a year before. It blamed an $850m payout to settle a price-rigging lawsuit, brought by New York attorney general Elliot Spitzer. Under the settlement announced in January, Marsh took a pre-tax charge of $618m in the October-to-December quarter, on top of the $232m charge from the previous quarter. ""Clearly 2004 was the most difficult year in MMC's financial history,"" Marsh chief executive Michael Cherkasky said.

An ongoing restructuring drive at the group also led to a $337m hit in the fourth quarter, the world's biggest insurer said.

Analysts expect its latest round of cuts to focus on its brokerage unit, which employs 40,000 staff. The latest layoffs will take the total number of jobs to go at the firm to 5,500 and are expected to lead to annual savings of more than $375m. As part of its efforts to cut costs, the company said it was halving its dividend payment to 17 cents a shares from 34 cents, a move which should enable it to save $360m. Looking ahead, Mr Cherkasky forecast profitable growth for the year ahead ""with an operating margin in the upper-teens, and with the opportunity for further margin expansion"". Meanwhile, the company also announced it would spin-off its MMC Capital private equity unit, which manages the $3bn Trident Funds operation, to a group of employees. Marsh did not say when the move would take place, but said it had signed a letter of intent.

The insurer hit the headlines in October last year when it faced accusations of price rigging. New York Attorney General Elliot Spitzer sued the company, accusing it of receiving illegal payments to steer clients to selected firms as well as rigging bids and fixing prices. In January, Marsh agreed to pay $850m to settle the suit - a figure in line with the placement fees it collected in 2003 - and agreed to change its business practices. In February, a former senior executive pleaded guilty to criminal charges in a wide-ranging probe of fraud and bid-rigging in the insurance industry. In January, a former senior vice president also pleaded guilty to criminal charges related to the investigation. In an effort to reform its business practises, Marsh said it has already introduced new leadership, new compliance procedures and new ways of dealing with customers. ""As a result, we are ready to put these matters behind us and move ahead in 2005 to restore the trust our clients have placed in us and to rebuild shareholder value,"" Mr Cherkasky said.

70,"Car giant hit by Mercedes slump

A slump in profitability at luxury car maker Mercedes has prompted a big drop in profits at parent DaimlerChrysler.

The German-US carmaker saw fourth quarter operating profits fall to 785m euros ($1bn) from 2.4bn euros in 2003. Mercedes-Benz's woes - its profits slid to just 20m euros - obscured a strong performance from the Chrysler group whose returns met market expectations. Mercedes faces fierce competition in the luxury car sector from BMW and but hopes to revive its fortunes by 2006.

Mercedes' profits over the period compared unfavourably with 2003's 784m euro figure and were well below analyst expectations of 374m euros. For the year as a whole, its operating profits fell 46% to 1.6bn euros. Sales of Mercedes' brands fell 2% as demand cooled, while revenues were affected by the weakness of the US dollar.

The carmaker blamed the fall in profits on high launch costs for new models and losses from its Mercedes Smart mini-car range. Mercedes is hoping to increase productivity by 3bn euros, having negotiated 500m euros in annual savings with German workers last year. The firm said it was determined to retain Mercedes' position as the world's most successful luxury brand. However, DaimlerChrysler's shares fell 1.5% on the news. ""While all these divisions are doing well the big worries continue to surround Mercedes-Benz,"" Michael Rabb, an analyst with Bank Sal Oppenheim, told Reuters.

In contrast, Chrysler enjoyed a 5% annual increase in unit sales while revenues - calculated in US dollars - rose 10%. The US division - whose marques include Dodge and Jeep - transformed a full year operating loss of 506m euros in 2003 into a 1.4bn euros profit last year.

Overall, DaimlerChrysler saw worldwide vehicle sales rise 8% to 4.7 million in 2004 while total revenues added 4% to 142bn euros. Chrysler's strong performance helped the world's fifth largest carmaker boost net income by 400m euros to 2.5bn euros.

""The year 2004 shows that our strategy works well - even in such a challenging competitive environment,"" said Jurgen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's chairman. DaimlerChrysler took a 475m euro hit in costs stemming from a defects scandal at its joint venture, Japanese subsidiary Fuso. DaimlerChrysler last week agreed a compensation package with partner Mitsubishi Motors which will see it buy out its stake in Fuso. Looking forward, DaimerChrysler's profits are expected to be slightly higher in 2005. However, it is expecting ""significant improvements"" in profitability in 2006 as a result of a major investment in the Mercedes product range.

71,"Millions go missing at China bank

Two senior officials at one of China's top commercial banks have reportedly disappeared after funds worth up to $120m (£64m) went missing.

The pair both worked at Bank of China in the northern city of Harbin, the South China Morning Post reported. The latest scandal at Bank of China will do nothing to reassure foreign investors that China's big four banks are ready for international listings. Government policy sees the bank listings as vital economic reforms. Bank of China is one of two frontrunners in the race to list overseas. The other is China Construction Bank. Both are expected to list abroad during 2005.

They shared a $45bn state bailout in 2003, to help clean up their balance sheets in preparation for a foreign stock market debut.

However, a report in the China-published Economic Observer said on Monday that the two banks may have scrapped plans to list in New York because of the cost of meeting regulatory requirements imposed since the Enron scandal. Bank of China is the country's biggest foreign exchange dealer, while China Construction Bank is the largest deposit holder. China's banking sector is burdened with at least $190bn of bad debt according to official data, though most observers believe the true figure is far higher. Officially, one in five loans is not being repaid. Attempts to strengthen internal controls and tighten lending policies have uncovered a succession of scandals involving embezzlement by bank officials and loans-for-favours. The most high-profile case involved the ex-president of Bank of China, Wang Xuebing, jailed for 12 years in 2003. Although, he committed the offences whilst running Bank of China in New York, Mr Wang was head of China Construction Bank when the scandal broke. Earlier this month, a China Construction Bank branch manager was jailed for life in a separate case.

China's banks used to act as cash offices for state enterprises and did not require checks on credit worthiness. The introduction of market reforms has been accompanied by attempts to modernise the banking sector, but links between banks and local government remain strong. Last year, China's premier, Wen Jiabao, targeted bank lending practices in a series of speeches, and regulators ordered all big loans to be scrutinised, in an attempt to cool down irresponsible lending. China's leaders see reforming the top four banks as vital to distribute capital to profitable companies and protect the health of China's economic boom. But two problems persist. First, inefficient state enterprises continue to receive protection from bankruptcy because they employ large numbers of people. Second, many questionable loans come not from the big four, but from smaller banks. Another high profile financial firm, China Life, is facing shareholder lawsuits and a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission following its 2004 New York listing over its failure to disclose accounting irregularities at its parent company.

The fourth-quarter losses at General Motors Europe totalled $345m, up from $66m during the same period in 2003. GM's main European brands are Opel and Vauxhall.

Excluding special items, GM's global income from continuing operations totalled $569m during the quarter, down from $838m a year earlier. The results were in line with Wall Street expectations and shares in GM rose by about 1% in pre-market trade. For the whole of 2004, GM earned $3.7bn, down from $3.8bn in 2003, while its annual revenue rose 4.5% to $193bn. GM said its profits were also hit by higher healthcare costs in the US. ""GM reported solid overall results in 2004, despite challenging competitive conditions in many markets around the globe,"" GM chairman and chief executive Rick Wagoner said in a statement. The company recently announced that it expected profits in 2005 to be lower than in 2004.

Libya has withdrawn $1bn in assets from the US, assets which had previously been frozen for almost 20 years, the Libyan central bank has said.

The move came after the US lifted a trade ban to reward Tripoli for giving up weapons of mass destruction and vowing to compensate Lockerbie victims. The original size of Libya's funds was $400m, the central bank told Reuters. However, the withdrawal did not mean that Libya had cut its ties with the US, he added.

""We are in the process of opening accounts in banks in the United States,"" the central bank's vice president Farhat Omar Ben Gadaravice said. The previously frozen assets had been invested in various countries and are believed to have included equity holdings in banks. The US ban on trade and economic activity with Tripoli - imposed by then president Ronald Regan in 1986 after a series of what the US deemed terrorist acts, including the 1988 Lockerbie air crash - was suspended in April. Bankers from the two country's had been working on how to unfreeze Libya's assets.

The UK's biggest brewer, Scottish and Newcastle (S&N), is to buy 37.5% of India's United Breweries in a deal worth 4.66bn rupees ($106m:£54.6m).

S&N will buy a 17.5% equity stake in United, maker of the well-known Kingfisher lager brand, and make a public offer to buy another 20% stake. A similar holding will be controlled by Vijay Mallya, chair of the Indian firm. The deal was a ""natural development"" of its joint venture with United, said Tony Froggatt, S&N's chief executive.

Its top brands include Newcastle Brown Ale, Foster's, John Smith's, Strongbow and Kronenbourg. In 2002 S&N and United agreed to form a strategic partnership, one that would include a joint venture business and a UK investment in the Indian brewer. The joint venture was established in May 2003. with both parties having a 40% stake in the venture - Millennium Alcobev. Millennium Alcobev will now be merged with United, which expects post-merger to have about half of India's beer market.

India, with a population of more than one billion, consumes about 1.2 billion bottles of beer every year. Kingfisher has market share of about 29%. In addition to the equity stake S&N is to invest 2.47bn rupees in United through non-convertible redeemable preference shares. Meanwhile, United's budget airline, Kingfisher Airlines, is to buy 10 A320 aircraft from Airbus and has the option to buy 20 more aircraft in a deal worth up to $1.8bn.

A total of 48% of chartered surveyor estate agents reported lower prices in the three months to November - the highest level in 12 years. Meanwhile the number of sales dropped 32% to an average of 22 per surveyor. The amount of unsold properties on their books rose for the sixth month in a row to an average of 67 properties. ""The slowdown occurring in the market has given buyers more power to negotiate, but this time of year is traditionally a quiet one,"" RICS housing spokesman Ian Perry said. ""The decision by the Bank of England not to increase interest rates further and the healthy economy is allowing confidence to consolidate.""

The figures support recent data from the government and other bodies which all point to a slowdown in the housing market. On Monday, the Council of Mortgage Lenders, British Bankers Association and Building Societies Association all said mortgage lending was slowing. The figures were published as another survey by property website Rightmove said the average asking price of a home fell by more than £600 from £190,329 in November to £189,733 in December. Around the UK, the Midlands and South saw the biggest price falls, while London prices fell but at less than the national rate. In Scotland, where prices have remained on an upward path, increases were more ""moderate"", RICS added. But the news failed to dent confidence that sales will recover in future, with surveyors at their most optimistic in a year - as new purchase inquiries stabilised despite holding at lower levels. ""Sales usually pick up in the New Year and I am confident this year will be no exception,"" Mr Perry added. Looking ahead, the group is anticipating a quiet start to 2005 with the market picking up in the second half - prompting a 3% rise in prices over the coming 12 months.

77,"Bush to get 'tough' on deficit

US president George W Bush has pledged to introduce a ""tough"" federal budget next February in a bid to halve the country's deficit in five years.

The US budget and its trade deficit are both deep in the red, helping to push the dollar to lows against the euro and fuelling fears about the economy. Mr Bush indicated there would be ""strict discipline"" on non-defence spending in the budget. The vow to cut the deficit had been one of his re-election declarations. The federal budget deficit hit a record $412bn (£211.6bn) in the 12 months to 30 September and $377bn in the previous year.

""We will submit a budget that fits the times,"" Mr Bush said. ""It will provide every tool and resource to the military, will protect the homeland, and meet other priorities of the government."" The US has said it is committed to a strong dollar. But the dollar's weakness has hit European and Asian exporters and lead to calls for US intervention to boost the currency. Mr Bush, however, has said the best way to halt the dollar's slide is to deal with the US deficit. ""It's a budget that I think will send the right signal to the financial markets and to those concerned about our short-term deficits,"" Mr Bush added. ""As well, we've got to deal with the long-term deficit issues.""

78,"Yukos unit fetches $9bn at auction

A little-known Russian company has bought the main production unit of oil giant Yukos at auction in Moscow.

Baikal Finance Group outbid favourite Gazprom, the state-controlled gas monopoly, to buy Yuganskneftegas. Baikal paid 260.75bn roubles ($9.37bn: £4.8bn) for Yugansk - nowhere near the $27bn Russia says Yukos owes in taxes. Yukos reacted immediately by repeating its view that the auction was illegal in international and Russian law, and said Baikal had bought itself trouble.

""The company considers that the victor of today's auction has bought itself a serious $9bn headache,"" said Yukos spokesman Alexander Shadrin. He said the company would continue to make ""every lawful move"" to protect tens of thousands of shareholders in Yukos from ""this forcible and illegitimate removal of their property"". Meanwhile, Tim Osborne, head of Yukos main shareholders' group Menatep, said that Yukos may have to declare itself bankrupt, and that legal action would be taken, outside Russia, against the auction winners. Reports from Russia say Baikal has paid a deposit of nearly $1.7bn from a Sberbank (Savings Bank) account to the Russian Federal Property Fund, for Yugansk.

The sale came despite a restraining order issued by a US court dealing with the firm's bankruptcy application for Chapter 11 protection. Yukos has always insisted the auction was state-sponsored theft but Russian authorities argued they were imposing the law, trying to recover billions in unpaid taxes. There were originally four registered bidders, and with its close ties to the Kremlin, state-backed gas monopoly Gazprom had been seen as favourite. But just two companies turned up for the auction, Gazprom and the unknown Baikal Finance Group, named after a large freshwater lake in Siberia. And, according to Tass news agency, Gazprom did not make a single bid, leaving the way open for Baikal, which paid above the auction start price of 246.75bn roubles.

Mystery firm Baikal Finance Group is officially registered in the central Russian region of Tver, but many analysts believe it may be linked to Gazprom. Kaha Kiknavelidze, analyst at Troika Dialog, said: ""I think a decision that Yugansk should end up with Gazprom was taken a long time ago. So the main question was how to structure this transaction.

""I would not exclude that the structure of the deal has slightly changed and Gazprom now has a partner. ""I would also not exclude that Baikal will decline to pay in 14 days, that are given by law, and Gazprom is then recognised as the winner. This would give Gazprom an extra 14 days to accumulate the needed funds. ""Another surprise was that the winner paid a significant premium above the starting price."" However, Gazprom has announced it is not linked to Baikal in any way. And Paul Collison, chief analyst at Brunswick UBS, said: ""I see no plausible explanation for the theory that Baikal was representing competing interests. ""Yugansk will most likely end up with Gazprom but could still end up with the government. There is still potential for surprises."" Yugansk is at the heart of Yukos - pumping close to a million barrels of oil a day. The unit was seized by the government which claims the oil giant owes more than $27bn in taxes and fines. Yukos says those tax demands are exorbitant, and had sought refuge in US courts.

The US bankruptcy court's initial order on Thursday - to temporarily block the sale - in response to Yukos filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, was upheld in a second ruling on Saturday. The protection, if recognised by the Russian authorities, would have allowed Yukos' current management to retain control of the business and block the sale of any company assets. Yukos has said the sale amounts to expropriation - punishment for the political ambitions of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Mr Khodorkovsky is now in jail, on separate fraud charges. But President Vladimir Putin has described the affair as a crackdown on corruption - and the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says most Russians believe the destruction of Yukos is now inevitable. Hours before the auction lawyers for Menatep, a group through which Mr Khodorkovsky and his associates control Yukos, said they would take legal action in other countries. Menatep lawyers, who were excluded from observing the auction, said they would retaliate by seeking injunctions in foreign courts to impound Russian oil and gas exports.

79,"China suspends 26 power projects

China has ordered a halt to construction work on 26 big power stations, including two at the Three Gorges Dam, on environmental grounds.

The move is a surprising one because China is struggling to increase energy supplies for its booming economy. Last year 24 provinces suffered black outs. The State Environmental Protection Agency said the 26 projects had failed to do proper environmental assessments. Topping the list was a controversial dam on the scenic upper Yangtze River. ""Construction of these projects has started without approval of the assessment of their environmental impact... they are typical illegal projects of construction first, approval next,"" said SEPA vice-director Pan Yue, in a statement on the agency's website.

Some of the projects may be allowed to start work again with the proper permits, but others would be cancelled, he said. Altogether, the agency ordered 30 projects halted. Other projects included a petrochemicals plant and a port in Fujian. The bulk of the list was made up of new power plants, with some extensions to existing ones. The stoppages would appear to be another step in the central government's battle to control projects licensed by local officials. However, previous crackdowns have tended to focus on projects for which the government argued there was overcapacity, such as steel and cement. The government has encouraged construction of new electricity generating capacity to solve chronic energy shortages which forced many factories onto part-time working last year. In 2004, China increased its generating capacity by 12.6%, or 440,700 megawatts (MW). The biggest single project to be halted was the Xiluodi Dam project, designed to produce 12,600 MW of electricity. It is being built on the Jinshajiang - or 'river of golden sand' as the upper reaches of the Yangtze are known. Second and third on the agency's list were two power stations being built at the $22bn Three Gorges Dam project on the central Yangtze - an underground 4,200 MW power plant and a 100 MW plant.

The Three Gorges Dam has proved controversial in China - where more than half a million people have been relocated to make way for it - and abroad. It has drawn criticism from environmental groups and overseas human rights activists. The damming of the Upper Yangtze has also begun to attract criticism from environmentalists in China. In April 2004, central government officials ordered a halt to work on the nearby Nu River, which is part of a United Nations world heritage site, the Three Parallel Rivers site which covers the Yangtze, Mekong and Nu (also known as the Salween), according to the UK-published China Review. That move reportedly followed a protest from the Thai government about the downstream impact of the dams, and a critical documentary made by Chinese journalists. China's energy shortage influenced global prices for oil, coal and shipping last year.

80,"High fuel costs hit US airlines

Two of the largest airlines in the US - American and Southwest - have blamed record fuel prices for their disappointing quarterly results.

American Airlines' parent AMR reported a loss of $387m (£206m) for the fourth quarter of 2004, against a $111m loss for the same period a year earlier. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines saw its fourth-quarter 2004 profits fall 15% to $56m, against $66m a year earlier. Both said high fuel bills would continue to pressure revenues in 2005. American, the world's biggest airline by some measures, said it expected to report a loss for the first quarter of 2005. Southwest, which has the highest market value of any US carrier, said it would remain profitable despite high fuel prices.

AMR's shares were flat in Wednesday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, as the results were slightly better than analysts had anticipated. AMR's chief executive Gerard Arpey said the airline's difficulties reflected the situation within the industry. ""AMR's results for the fourth quarter of 2004 reflect the economic woes that plagued the airline industry throughout 2004 - in particular, high fuel prices and a tough revenue environment,"" he said. For the full year, AMR posted a loss of $761m, lower than 2003's $1.2bn loss and an indication that the airline has successfully cut costs. AMR added that as part of its cost cutting measures, it is postponing the delivery of 54 Boeing jets. Shares in Southwest fell 65 cents to $14.35 as analysts voiced their disappointment. ""The results came in below our already conservative estimate for the quarter,"" said Ray Neidl, an analyst at Calyon Securities. Both American and Southwest have been squeezed by cut-throat competition in the US airline industry, as a glut of available seats has led to fierce price reductions.

81,"J&J agrees $25bn Guidant deal

Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson has agreed to buy medical technology firm Guidant for $25.4bn (£13bn).

Guidant is a key producer of equipment that combats heart problems such as implant defibrillators and pacemakers. Analysts said that the deal is aimed at offsetting Johnson & Johnson's reliance on a slowing drug business. They also pointed out that more mergers are likely because the drug and healthcare industries are fragmented and are under pressure to cut costs. A number of Johnson & Johnson's products are facing patent expirations, while the company is also battling fierce competition from generic products. Meanwhile, demand for defibrillators, which give the heart a small electric shock when an irregular heartbeat or rhythm is detected, is expected to increase, analysts said. The move by Johnson & Johnson has been widely expected and the firm will pay $76 for each Guidant share, 6% more than Wednesday's closing price. Analysts say that US antitrust regulators could force the firms to shed some overlapping stent operations. Stents are tubes that are used to keep an artery open after it has been unblocked.

82,"China Aviation seeks rescue deal

Scandal-hit jet fuel supplier China Aviation Oil has offered to repay its creditors $220m (£117m) of the $550m it lost on trading in oil futures.

The firm said it hoped to pay $100m now and another $120m over eight years. With assets of $200m and liabilities totalling $648m, it needs creditors' backing for the offer to avoid going into bankruptcy. The trading scandal is the biggest to hit Singapore since the $1.2bn collapse of Barings Bank in 1995. Chen Jiulin, chief executive of China Aviation Oil (CAO), was arrested by at Changi Airport by Singapore police on 8 December. He was returning from China, where he had headed when CAO announced its trading debacle in late-November. The firm had been betting heavily on a fall in the price of oil during October, but prices rose sharply instead.

Among the creditors whose backing CAO needs for its restructuring plan are banking giants such as Barclay's Capital and Sumitomo Mitsui, as well as South Korean firm SK Energy. Of the immediate payment, the firm - China's biggest jet fuel supplier - said it would be paying $30m out of its own resources. The rest would come from its parent company, China Aviation Oil Holding Company in Beijing. The holding company, owned by the Chinese government, holds most of CAO's Singapore-listed shares. It cut its holding from 75% to 60% on 20 October.

83,"Japan bank shares up on link talk

Shares of Sumitomo Mitsui Financial (SMFG), and Daiwa Securities jumped amid speculation that two of Japan's biggest financial companies will merge.

Financial newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun claimed that the firms will join up next year and already have held discussions with Japanese regulators. The firms denied that they are about to link up, but said they are examining ways of working more closely together. SMFG shares climbed by 2.7% to 717,000, and Daiwa added 5.3% to 740 yen.

Combining SMFG, Japan's third-biggest lender, and Daiwa, the country's second-largest brokerage firm, would create a company with assets of more than $1,000bn (£537bn). SMFG President Yoshifumi Nishikawa said that the companies needed to bolster their businesses. ""Both companies need to strengthen retail and other operations,"" he said, adding that ""it's an issue we have in common"". Daiwa said that ""although it is true that the two groups have been engaging in various discussions to enhance cooperation, there are no plans to enter into negotiations to consolidate the two businesses"". Analysts said that consolidation in Japan's financial sector was likely to continue and that it was likely to have a positive impact on earnings. ""Cross-selling opportunities between banks and brokers are increasing thanks to deregulation, so we can expect the relationship to get even stronger,"" said Heronry Nozaki, an analyst at NikkoCitigroup. The merger ""would be a good move,"" he added.

85,"Wembley firm won't make a profit

Shares in Multiplex Group, which is building the new Wembley stadium, fell as much as 19% after it said it would not make any money on the project.

The Australian firm said it would only break even on the 1.2bn Australian dollars (£458m; $874m) rebuild, after a rise in costs on the work. Any profits would depend on the outcome of legal cases resulting from a change in steel contractor, it added. It cut A$68m from profit targets for Wembley and another UK project.

Investors were shaken by the news and the firm's shares fell to a four month low of A$4.50, before recovering to close 16% down at A$4.67. The decline came despite Multiplex reporting an 11% rise in pre-tax profits to A$67.7m for 2004 and reaffirming its 2005 profit forecasts. Increased costs at Wembley and a separate development in London's Docklands saw Multiplex's construction division report profits of A$35.1m.

The firm said the result was below expectations but stressed that the majority of its UK projects - which also include the White City redevelopment scheme in west London - were performing strongly.

To recoup any profit from Wembley, where the firm changed its steel contractor due to a legal dispute, Multiplex will have to win legal claims against subcontractors. These claims could take up to two years to resolve. ""Multiplex believes its claim are sound and ultimately will exceed the level needed to support the break even position,"" it said. ""It is expected that profits will be possible in future periods as the claims are finalised."" Wembley Stadium is to due to be completed in January and will officially open for the 2006 FA Cup Final. Analysts expressed concern at the unexpected paring back in profit. ""Such a big writeback on the Wembley project in such a short period has impacted on management credibility,"" Simon Wheatley, from Goldman Sachs, told Reuters.

87,"Europe blames US over weak dollar

European leaders have openly blamed the US for the sharp rise in the value of the euro.

US officials were talking up the dollar, they said, but failing to take action to back up their words. Meeting in Brussels, finance ministers of the 12 eurozone countries voiced their concern that the rise of the european currency was harming exports. The dollar is within touching distance of an all-time low reached earlier in November. At 0619 GMT on Tuesday, the dollar was up slightly at just above $1.29 to the euro, and buying 105.6 yen in Tokyo. It rallied briefly on Monday amid signs that oil prices are easing.

But analysts said the respite was likely to be only temporary. The European ministers' comments, said Junya Tanase of JPMorgan Chase bank in Tokyo, were ""generally too weak to produce a market reaction"".

Still, by the standards of diplomacy the European ministers were forthright. Nicolas Sarkozy of France said he and his colleagues were unanimous in their worry that the decline of the dollar would hit Europe's economies by eating into their exports. ""We are concerned about these developments, which are destabilising, and which are linked to the accumulation of deficits by our American friends,"" he said. The comments come a day after US Treasury Secretary John Snow said a strong dollar was ""in America's interest"".

But that was not enough for Mr Sarkozy.

""If the Americans were to change their policy, it's up to them to say so,"" he said. And the European Union's monetary affairs commissioner, made it clear that action was necessary. ""I fully welcome the words of Mr Snow,"" said Joaquin Almunia, ""but we will need to see decisions adopted in that direction. ""If the imbalances in the US economy are not adjusted in the future, the decision in the market will be as in the past weeks."" Economists point out that whatever Europe says, in the short term a weaker dollar is a boon to President George W Bush's administration. Not only does it boost US exports, but it also makes the budget deficit easier to fund. On the other hand, slower European exports would mean slower EU growth - potentially reducing the demand for US goods.

88,"Survey confirms property slowdown

Government figures have confirmed a widely reported slowdown of the UK's housing market in late 2004.

House prices were 11.8% higher on the year in the last quarter of 2004, down from 16.3% in the July-to-September quarter, the Land Registry said. The average house price in England and Wales was £182,920, down from £187,971 in July-September. The volume of sales between October and December dropped by nearly a quarter from the same period in 2003. The government figures are the first official confirmation of falls in the market at the end of 2004. Land Registry figures are less up to date than those of banks and building societies, since they record completions not mortgage approvals. However, the figures are viewed as the most accurate measure of house prices as they include all property transactions, including cash sales.

The cost of buying a home fell in seven out of 10 regions between the third and fourth quarters of 2004.

The biggest annual gains were made in Wales, where house prices were up by 23% in the fourth quarter. House prices rose the slowest in Greater London, being up by 6%. In the capital, the volume of sales fell by 23% from 36,185 in 2003 to 28,041 for the same period in 2004. There was also a decline in the number of million-pound properties sold in the capital, with 436 properties over £1m sold compared to 469 for the same period in 2003. Although the figures point to a slowdown in the market, the most recent surveys from Nationwide and Halifax have indicated the market may be undergoing a revival. After registering falls at the back end of 2004, Halifax said house prices rose by 0.8% in January and Nationwide reported a rise of 0.4% in the first month of the year. Members of the Bank of England's rate-setting committee will make their latest decision on interest rates on Thursday.

89,"Asia shares defy post-quake gloom

Indonesian, Indian and Hong Kong stock markets reached record highs.

Investors seemed to feel that some of the worst-affected areas were so under-developed that the tragedy would have little impact on Asia's listed firms. ""Obviously with a lot of loss of life, a lot of time is needed to clean up the mess, bury the people and find the missing,"" said ABN Amro's Eddie Wong. ""[But] it's not necessarily a really big thing in the economic sense.""

India's Bombay Stock Exchange inched slightly above its previous record close on Wednesday. Expectations of strong corporate earnings in 2005 drove the Indonesian stock exchange in Jakarta to a record high on Wednesday. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index may be benefiting in part from the potential for its listed property companies to gain from rebuilding contracts in the tsunami-affected regions of South East Asia. In Sri Lanka, some economists have said that as much as 1% of annual growth may be lost. Sri Lanka's stock market has fallen about 5% since the weekend, but it is still 40% higher than at the start of 2004.

Thailand may lose 30bn baht (£398m; $768m) in earnings from tourism over the next three months, according to tourism minister Sontaya Kunplome.

In the affected provinces, he expects the loss of tourism revenue to be offset by government reconstruction spending. Thailand intends to spend a similar sum - around 30bn baht - on the rebuilding work. ""It will take until the fourth quarter of next year before tourist visitors in Phuket and five other provinces return to their normal level,"" said Naris Chaiyasoot, director general at the ministry's fiscal policy office. In the Maldives the cost of reconstruction could wipe out economic growth, according to a government spokesman. ""Our nation is in peril here,"" said Ahmed Shaheed, the chief government spokesman. He estimated the economic cost of the disaster at hundreds of millions of dollars. The Maldives has gross domestic product of $660m. ""It won't be surprising if the cost exceeds our GDP,"" he said. ""In the last few years, we made great progress in our standard of living - the United Nations recognised this. Now we see this can disappear in a few days, a few minutes."" Shaheed noted that investment in a single tourist resort - the economic mainstay - could run to $40m. Between 10 and 12 of the 80-odd resorts have been severely damaged, and a similar number have suffered significant damage.

However, many experts, including the World Bank, have pointed out that it is still difficult to assess the magnitude of the disaster and its likely economic impact. In part, this is because of its scale, and because delivering aid and recovering the dead remain priorities. ""Calculators will have to wait,"" said an IMF official in a briefing on Wednesday. ""The financial and world community will be turning toward reconstruction efforts and at that point people will begin to have a sense of the financial impact.""
